00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.449
Chapter 7

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.780
It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at
its highest that the lights in his house failed

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.650
to go on one Saturday night — and, as obscurely
as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.369
was over. Only gradually did I become aware
that the automobiles which turned expectantly

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.519
into his drive stayed for just a minute and
then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.400
sick I went over to find out — an unfamiliar
butler with a villainous face squinted at

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.020
me suspiciously from the door.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.440
“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.720
“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir”
in a dilatory, grudging way.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.690
“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather
worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.500
“Who?” he demanded rudely.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.570
“Carraway.”

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.830
“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”
Abruptly he slammed the door.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.820
My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed
every servant in his house a week ago and

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.800
replaced them with half a dozen others, who
never went into West Egg Village to be bribed

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.730
by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies
over the telephone. The grocery boy reported

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.260
that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and
the general opinion in the village was that

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.280
the new people weren’t servants at all.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.820
Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.790
“Going away?” I inquired.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.830
“No, old sport.”

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.500
“I hear you fired all your servants.”

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.229
“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip.
Daisy comes over quite often — in the afternoons.”

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.390
So the whole caravansary had fallen in like
a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.049
“They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted
to do something for. They’re all brothers

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.299
and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.560
“I see.”

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.780
He was calling up at Daisy’s request — would
I come to lunch at her house to-morrow? Miss

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.590
Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy
herself telephoned and seemed relieved to

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.840
find that I was coming. Something was up.
And yet I couldn’t believe that they would

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.280
choose this occasion for a scene — especially
for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.840
had outlined in the garden.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.650
The next day was broiling, almost the last,
certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.069
train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight,
only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.480
Company broke the simmering hush at noon.
The straw seats of the car hovered on the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.480
edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired
delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.090
and then, as her newspaper dampened under
her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.520
heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book
slapped to the floor.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.410
“Oh, my!” she gasped.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.280
I picked it up with a weary bend and handed
it back to her, holding it at arm’s length

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.270
and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate
that I had no designs upon it — but every

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.020
one near by, including the woman, suspected
me just the same.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:41.849
“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar
faces. “Some weather! hot! hot! hot! Is

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.150
it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it..
.?”

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.390
My commutation ticket came back to me with
a dark stain from his hand. That any one should

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.930
care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,
whose head made damp the pajama pocket over

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.810
his heart!

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.290
. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans’
house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.980
of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me
as we waited at the door.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.709
“The master’s body!” roared the butler
into the mouthpiece. “I’m sorry, madame,

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.659
but we can’t furnish it — it’s far too
hot to touch this noon!”

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:31.400
What he really said was: “Yes . . . yes
. . . I’ll see.”

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.009
He set down the receiver and came toward us,
glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.240
hats.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.729
“Madame expects you in the salon!” he
cried, needlessly indicating the direction.

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.849
In this heat every extra gesture was an affront
to the common store of life.

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:58.069
The room, shadowed well with awnings, was
dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:04.619
enormous couch, like silver idols weighing
down their own white dresses against the singing

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:06.379
breeze of the fans.

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.860
“We can’t move,” they said together.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.569
Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their
tan, rested for a moment in mine.

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:22.759
“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?”
I inquired.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:29.180
Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled,
husky, at the hall telephone.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.589
Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson
carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes.

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:41.219
Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet,
exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:43.349
from her bosom into the air.

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:51.419
“The rumor is,” whispered Jordan, “that
that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.”

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:58.430
We were silent. The voice in the hall rose
high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.649
won’t sell you the car at all. . . . I’m
under no obligations to you at all . . . and

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:10.819
as for your bothering me about it at lunch
time, I won’t stand that at all!”

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.710
“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy
cynically.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:22.899
“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s
a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:27.949
Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space
for a moment with his thick body, and hurried

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.240
into the room.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:36.009
“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat
hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.189
glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick . . . .”

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:43.759
“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.960
As he left the room again she got up and went
over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.839
him on the mouth.

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:54.729
“You know I love you,” she murmured.

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:00.219
“You forget there’s a lady present,”
said Jordan.

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:02.360
Daisy looked around doubtfully.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.719
“You kiss Nick too.”

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:07.819
“What a low, vulgar girl!”

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:14.740
“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began
to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.960
the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch
just as a freshly laundered nurse leading

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.779
a little girl came into the room.

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:30.849
“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding
out her arms. “Come to your own mother that

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:32.669
loves you.”

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:38.429
The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed
across the room and rooted shyly into her

00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:40.169
mother’s dress.

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:46.669
“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get
powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.039
now, and say — How-de-do.”

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:56.059
Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took
the small, reluctant hand. Afterward he kept

00:07:56.059 --> 00:08:02.629
looking at the child with surprise. I don’t
think he had ever really believed in its existence

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:04.080
before.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.459
“I got dressed before luncheon,” said
the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:16.499
“That’s because your mother wanted to
show you off.” Her face bent into the single

00:08:16.499 --> 00:08:23.849
wrinkle of the small, white neck. “You dream,
you. You absolute little dream.”

00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:31.569
“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt
Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:36.940
“How do you like mother’s friends?”
Daisy turned her around so that she faced

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.570
Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.050
“Where’s Daddy?”

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:48.090
“She doesn’t look like her father,”
explained Daisy. “She looks like me. She’s

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.490
got my hair and shape of the face.”

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:57.370
Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took
a step forward and held out her hand.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.620
“Come, Pammy.”

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.870
“Good-by, sweetheart!”

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:07.400
With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined
child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:14.930
out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding
four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.540
Gatsby took up his drink.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:23.520
“They certainly look cool,” he said, with
visible tension.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.720
We drank in long, greedy swallows.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.500
“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting
hotter every year,” said Tom genially. “It

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:39.030
seems that pretty soon the earth’s going
to fall into the sun — or wait a minute

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:44.380
— it’s just the opposite — the sun’s
getting colder every year.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:51.190
“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby,
“I’d like you to have a look at the place.”

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:58.530
I went with them out to the veranda. On the
green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:05.560
sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.
Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.550
raised his hand and pointed across the bay.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.200
“I’m right across from you.”

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.720
“So you are.”

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.840
Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the
hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:27.910
along-shore. Slowly the white wings of the
boat moved against the blue cool limit of

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:34.870
the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and
the abounding blessed isles.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:41.510
“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding.
“I’d like to be out there with him for

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.690
about an hour.”

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:50.430
We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened
too against the heat, and drank down nervous

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.020
gayety with the cold ale.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:59.790
“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?”
cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.090
the next thirty years?”

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:08.350
“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life
starts all over again when it gets crisp in

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.200
the fall.”

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:16.330
“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on
the verge of tears, “and everything’s

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.490
so confused. Let’s all go to town!”

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:26.500
Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating
against it, molding its senselessness into

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.670
forms.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:33.340
“I’ve heard of making a garage out of
a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.790
I’m the first man who ever made a stable
out of a garage.”

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:44.790
“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy
insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:50.870
her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:57.930
Their eyes met, and they stared together at
each other, alone in space. With an effort

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.740
she glanced down at the table.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.190
“You always look so cool,” she repeated.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:12.750
She had told him that she loved him, and Tom
Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:18.800
opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby,
and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.350
her as some one he knew a long time ago.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:29.210
“You resemble the advertisement of the man,”
she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.650
of the man ——”

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:35.760
“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m
perfectly willing to go to town. Come on — we’re

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.450
all going to town.”

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:43.580
He got up, his eyes still flashing between
Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:49.050
“Come on!” His temper cracked a little.
“What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.010
going to town, let’s start.”

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:57.730
His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control,
bore to his lips the last of his glass of

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:04.090
ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and
out on to the blazing gravel drive.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:09.940
“Are we just going to go?” she objected.
“Like this? Aren’t we going to let any

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.290
one smoke a cigarette first?”

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.700
“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:21.920
“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him.
“It’s too hot to fuss.” He didn’t

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.760
answer.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.440
“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come
on, Jordan.”

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.100
They went up-stairs to get ready while we
three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:40.060
with our feet. A silver curve of the moon
hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:46.410
started to speak, changed his mind, but not
before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:52.190
“Have you got your stables here?” asked
Gatsby with an effort.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.850
“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:55.770
“Oh.”

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.620
A pause.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:04.940
“I don’t see the idea of going to town,”
broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.340
notions in their heads ——”

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:11.910
“Shall we take anything to drink?” called
Daisy from an upper window.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:18.260
“I’ll get some whiskey,” answered Tom.
He went inside.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.950
Gatsby turned to me rigidly:

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.810
“I can’t say anything in his house, old
sport.”

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:32.300
“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked.
“It’s full of ——” I hesitated.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.930
“Her voice is full of money,” he said
suddenly.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:45.279
That was it. I’d never understood before.
It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:52.760
charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle
of it, the cymbals’ song of it. . . . high

00:14:52.760 --> 00:15:00.930
in a white palace the king’s daughter, the
golden girl. . . .

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:05.730
Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart
bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:11.860
wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth
and carrying light capes over their arms.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:17.870
“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested
Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.930
the seat. “I ought to have left it in the
shade.”

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.610
“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.510
“Yes.”

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.960
“Well, you take my coupe and let me drive
your car to town.”

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.330
The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.990
“I don’t think there’s much gas,”
he objected.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.420
“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously.
He looked at the gauge. “And if it runs

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.060
out I can stop at a drug-store. You can buy
anything at a drug-store nowadays.”

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:54.470
A pause followed this apparently pointless
remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and

00:15:54.470 --> 00:16:02.220
an indefinable expression, at once definitely
unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.140
I had only heard it described in words, passed
over Gatsby’s face.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:13.470
“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her
with his hand toward Gatsby’s car. “I’ll

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.170
take you in this circus wagon.”

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.900
He opened the door, but she moved out from
the circle of his arm.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.760
“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow
you in the coupe.”

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:31.390
She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat
with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:37.540
the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed
the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.839
off into the oppressive heat, leaving them
out of sight behind.

00:16:41.839 --> 00:16:45.570
“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.540
“See what?”

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.130
He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan
and I must have known all along.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:17:00.140
“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?”
he suggested. “Perhaps I am, but I have

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:07.159
a — almost a second sight, sometimes, that
tells me what to do. Maybe you don’t believe

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:09.600
that, but science ——”

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:15.809
He paused. The immediate contingency overtook
him, pulled him back from the edge of the

00:17:15.809 --> 00:17:17.709
theoretical abyss.

00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:23.379
“I’ve made a small investigation of this
fellow,” he continued. “I could have gone

00:17:23.379 --> 00:17:25.679
deeper if I’d known ——”

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:31.049
“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?”
inquired Jordan humorously.

00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:37.399
“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we
laughed. “A medium?”

00:17:37.399 --> 00:17:39.100
“About Gatsby.”

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:48.240
“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d
been making a small investigation of his past.”

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.450
“And you found he was an Oxford man,”
said Jordan helpfully.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:18:00.789
“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like
hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:04.559
“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:10.679
“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously,
“or something like that.”

00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:17.960
“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why
did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.289
crossly.

00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:26.210
“Daisy invited him; she knew him before
we were married — God knows where!”

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:32.070
We were all irritable now with the fading
ale, and aware of it we drove for a while

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:39.200
in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s
faded eyes came into sight down the road,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.240
I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.769
“We’ve got enough to get us to town,”
said Tom.

00:18:45.769 --> 00:18:51.200
“But there’s a garage right here,” objected
Jordan. “I don’t want to get stalled in

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:57.490
this baking heat.” Tom threw on both brakes
impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:03.850
stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment
the proprietor emerged from the interior of

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.769
his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at
the car.

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:13.549
“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly.
“What do you think we stopped for — to

00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:15.610
admire the view?”

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:22.480
“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving.
“Been sick all day.”

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.340
“What’s the matter?”

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.830
“I’m all run down.”

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:34.259
“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded.
“You sounded well enough on the phone.”

00:19:34.259 --> 00:19:40.230
With an effort Wilson left the shade and support
of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.509
the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face
was green.

00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:51.779
“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,”
he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and

00:19:51.779 --> 00:19:54.690
I was wondering what you were going to do
with your old car.”

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.799
“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom.
“I bought it last week.”

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:06.830
“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson,
as he strained at the handle.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.610
“Like to buy it?”

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:16.909
“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No,
but I could make some money on the other.”

00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:21.110
“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:28.389
“I’ve been here too long. I want to get
away. My wife and I want to go West.”

00:20:28.389 --> 00:20:33.129
“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.

00:20:33.129 --> 00:20:40.090
“She’s been talking about it for ten years.”
He rested for a moment against the pump, shading

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:47.600
his eyes. “And now she’s going whether
she wants to or not. I’m going to get her

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.879
away.”

00:20:49.879 --> 00:20:55.090
The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust
and the flash of a waving hand.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.889
“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.

00:20:58.889 --> 00:21:05.450
“I just got wised up to something funny
the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:10.519
why I want to get away. That’s why I been
bothering you about the car.”

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.820
“What do I owe you?”

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.940
“Dollar twenty.”

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.489
The relentless beating heat was beginning
to confuse me and I had a bad moment there

00:21:19.489 --> 00:21:26.299
before I realized that so far his suspicions
hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:31.360
that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from
him in another world, and the shock had made

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:38.269
him physically sick. I stared at him and then
at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery

00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:43.830
less than an hour before — and it occurred
to me that there was no difference between

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:49.190
men, in intelligence or race, so profound
as the difference between the sick and the

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:57.230
well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty,
unforgivably guilty — as if he had just

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.269
got some poor girl with child.

00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:09.090
“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom.
“I’ll send it over to-morrow afternoon.”

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:15.289
That locality was always vaguely disquieting,
even in the broad glare of afternoon, and

00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:21.460
now I turned my head as though I had been
warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:28.690
the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept
their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment,

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:35.279
that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar
intensity from less than twenty feet away.

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:39.389
In one of the windows over the garage the
curtains had been moved aside a little, and

00:22:39.389 --> 00:22:45.529
Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.
So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness

00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:51.779
of being observed, and one emotion after another
crept into her face like objects into a slowly

00:22:51.779 --> 00:22:58.470
developing picture. Her expression was curiously
familiar — it was an expression I had often

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:05.619
seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s
face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable

00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:12.360
until I realized that her eyes, wide with
jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:18.119
on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.

00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:23.440
There is no confusion like the confusion of
a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:30.759
feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and
his mistress, until an hour ago secure and

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:37.139
inviolate, were slipping precipitately from
his control. Instinct made him step on the

00:23:37.139 --> 00:23:43.320
accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking
Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:49.820
along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,
until, among the spidery girders of the elevated,

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.419
we came in sight of the easy-going blue coupe.

00:23:53.419 --> 00:24:00.499
“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street
are cool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New

00:24:00.499 --> 00:24:06.090
York on summer afternoons when every one’s
away. There’s something very sensuous about

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:13.720
it — overripe, as if all sorts of funny
fruits were going to fall into your hands.”

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.249
The word “sensuous” had the effect of
further disquieting Tom, but before he could

00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:24.309
invent a protest the coupe came to a stop,
and Daisy signaled us to draw up alongside.

00:24:24.309 --> 00:24:27.580
“Where are we going?” she cried.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.379
“How about the movies?”

00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:37.809
“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You
go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.”

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:43.559
With an effort her wit rose faintly, “We’ll
meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:45.629
smoking two cigarettes.”

00:24:45.629 --> 00:24:51.659
“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom
said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing

00:24:51.659 --> 00:24:57.909
whistle behind us. “You follow me to the
south side of Central Park, in front of the

00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:58.730
Plaza.”

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.330
Several times he turned his head and looked
back for their car, and if the traffic delayed

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:09.090
them he slowed up until they came into sight.
I think he was afraid they would dart down

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.909
a side street and out of his life forever.

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:18.539
But they didn’t. And we all took the less
explicable step of engaging the parlor of

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:21.779
a suite in the Plaza Hotel.

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:27.059
The prolonged and tumultuous argument that
ended by herding us into that room eludes

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:32.989
me, though I have a sharp physical memory
that, in the course of it, my underwear kept

00:25:32.989 --> 00:25:39.200
climbing like a damp snake around my legs
and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.989
across my back. The notion originated with
Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bath-rooms

00:25:45.989 --> 00:25:52.080
and take cold baths, and then assumed more
tangible form as “a place to have a mint

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:58.299
julep.” Each of us said over and over that
it was a “crazy idea.”— we all talked

00:25:58.299 --> 00:26:04.259
at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or
pretended to think, that we were being very

00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:04.970
funny.. ..

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:11.239
The room was large and stifling, and, though
it was already four o’clock, opening the

00:26:11.239 --> 00:26:17.289
windows admitted Only a gust of hot shrubbery
from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and

00:26:17.289 --> 00:26:20.639
stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.

00:26:20.639 --> 00:26:26.859
“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan
respectfully, and every one laughed.

00:26:26.859 --> 00:26:30.899
“Open another window,” commanded Daisy,
without turning around.

00:26:30.899 --> 00:26:33.159
“There aren’t any more.”

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:35.659
“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe
——”

00:26:35.659 --> 00:26:41.639
“The thing to do is to forget about the
heat,” said Tom impatiently. “You make

00:26:41.639 --> 00:26:44.759
it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:49.590
He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the
towel and put it on the table.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:55.480
“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked
Gatsby. “You’re the one that wanted to

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.549
come to town.”

00:26:57.549 --> 00:27:03.539
There was a moment of silence. The telephone
book slipped from its nail and splashed to

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:09.559
the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse
me.”— but this time no one laughed.

00:27:09.559 --> 00:27:12.600
“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:20.100
“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted
string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.549
way, and tossed the book on a chair.

00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:28.129
“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t
it?” said Tom sharply.

00:27:28.129 --> 00:27:29.309
“What is?”

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:35.220
“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d
you pick that up?”

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.649
“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning
around from the mirror, “if you’re going

00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:44.690
to make personal remarks I won’t stay here
a minute. Call up and order some ice for the

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.019
mint julep.”

00:27:47.019 --> 00:27:53.029
As Tom took up the receiver the compressed
heat exploded into sound and we were listening

00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:58.700
to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s
Wedding March from the ballroom below.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:05.109
“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!”
cried Jordan dismally.

00:28:05.109 --> 00:28:12.450
“Still — I was married in the middle of
June,” Daisy remembered, “Louisville in

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:17.609
June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted,
Tom?”

00:28:17.609 --> 00:28:20.109
“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.

00:28:20.109 --> 00:28:27.200
“A man named Biloxi. ‘blocks’ Biloxi,
and he made boxes — that’s a fact — and

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.009
he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”

00:28:29.009 --> 00:28:35.710
“They carried him into my house,” appended
Jordan, “because we lived just two doors

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:41.720
from the church. And he stayed three weeks,
until Daddy told him he had to get out. The

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:48.389
day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment
she added as if she might have sounded irreverent,

00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:50.649
“There wasn’t any connection.”

00:28:50.649 --> 00:28:56.169
“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,”
I remarked.

00:28:56.169 --> 00:29:02.279
“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family
history before he left. He gave me an aluminum

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:06.259
putter that I use to-day.”

00:29:06.259 --> 00:29:13.359
The music had died down as the ceremony began
and now a long cheer floated in at the window,

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:22.320
followed by intermittent cries of “Yea-ea-ea!”
and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.539
began.

00:29:23.539 --> 00:29:31.629
“We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If
we were young we’d rise and dance.”

00:29:31.629 --> 00:29:37.649
“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her.
“Where’d you know him, Tom?”

00:29:37.649 --> 00:29:44.629
“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort.
“I didn’t know him. He was a friend of

00:29:44.629 --> 00:29:45.100
Daisy’s.”

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.859
“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never
seen him before. He came down in the private

00:29:50.859 --> 00:29:51.779
car.”

00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:58.700
“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was
raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.519
around at the last minute and asked if we
had room for him.”

00:30:02.519 --> 00:30:04.080
Jordan smiled.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:10.899
“He was probably bumming his way home. He
told me he was president of your class at

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:11.659
Yale.”

00:30:11.659 --> 00:30:13.820
Tom and I looked at each other blankly.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.700
“Biloxi?”

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.479
“First place, we didn’t have any president
——”

00:30:19.479 --> 00:30:27.039
Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo
and Tom eyed him suddenly.

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:32.960
“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re
an Oxford man.”

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.369
“Not exactly.”

00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:40.840
“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.539
“Yes — I went there.”

00:30:43.539 --> 00:30:52.139
A pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and
insulting: “You must have gone there about

00:30:52.139 --> 00:30:56.789
the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”

00:30:56.789 --> 00:31:02.570
Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in
with crushed mint and ice but, the silence

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:08.479
was unbroken by his “thank you” and the
soft closing of the door. This tremendous

00:31:08.479 --> 00:31:12.029
detail was to be cleared up at last.

00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:15.859
“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.

00:31:15.859 --> 00:31:20.099
“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”

00:31:20.099 --> 00:31:27.119
“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed
five months. That’s why I can’t really

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:30.679
call myself an Oxford man.”

00:31:30.679 --> 00:31:36.919
Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his
unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.

00:31:36.919 --> 00:31:42.259
“It was an opportunity they gave to some
of the officers after the Armistice,” he

00:31:42.259 --> 00:31:47.330
continued. “We could go to any of the universities
in England or France.”

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:53.879
I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.
I had one of those renewals of complete faith

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:57.590
in him that I’d experienced before.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:01.239
Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the
table.

00:32:01.239 --> 00:32:05.529
“Open the whiskey, Tom,” she ordered,
“and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then

00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:12.809
you won’t seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look
at the mint!”

00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:19.590
“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want
to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.869
“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.

00:32:23.869 --> 00:32:30.570
“What kind of a row are you trying to cause
in my house anyhow?”

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:35.039
They were out in the open at last and Gatsby
was content.

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:41.999
“He isn’t causing a row.” Daisy looked
desperately from one to the other. “You’re

00:32:41.999 --> 00:32:45.080
causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:52.799
“Self-control!” Repeated Tom incredulously.
“I suppose the latest thing is to sit back

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:59.210
and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love
to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:06.239
can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin
by sneering at family life and family institutions,

00:33:06.239 --> 00:33:12.960
and next they’ll throw everything overboard
and have intermarriage between black and white.”

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.649
Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he
saw himself standing alone on the last barrier

00:33:17.649 --> 00:33:19.649
of civilization.

00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:24.869
“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:32.259
“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t
give big parties. I suppose you’ve got to

00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:36.700
make your house into a pigsty in order to
have any friends — in the modern world.”

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:44.450
Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted
to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.289
transition from libertine to prig was so complete.

00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:54.340
“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport
——” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.859
at his intention.

00:33:55.859 --> 00:34:01.129
“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly.
“Please let’s all go home. Why don’t

00:34:01.129 --> 00:34:02.830
we all go home?”

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:09.480
“That’s a good idea.” I got up. “Come
on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.570
“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell
me.”

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:20.600
“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby.
“She’s never loved you. She loves me.”

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:25.500
“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.429
Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:33.500
“She never loved you, do you hear?” he
cried. “She only married you because I was

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:39.360
poor and she was tired of waiting for me.
It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.150
she never loved any one except me!”

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:48.600
At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but
Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.290
that we remain — as though neither of them
had anything to conceal and it would be a

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:57.790
privilege to partake vicariously of their
emotions.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:05.400
“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped
unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.320
been going on? I want to hear all about it.”

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:15.360
“I told you what’s been going on,” said
Gatsby. “Going on for five years — and

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.570
you didn’t know.”

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.750
Tom turned to Daisy sharply.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:23.470
“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five
years?”

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:29.890
“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t
meet. But both of us loved each other all

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:35.760
that time, old sport, and you didn’t know.
I used to laugh sometimes.”— but there

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.300
was no laughter in his eyes ——” to think
that you didn’t know.”

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:46.820
“Oh — that’s all.” Tom tapped his
thick fingers together like a clergyman and

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.670
leaned back in his chair.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:54.430
“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t
speak about what happened five years ago,

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.550
because I didn’t know Daisy then — and
I’ll be damned if I see how you got within

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:03.520
a mile of her unless you brought the groceries
to the back door. But all the rest of that’s

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:10.280
a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she
married me and she loves me now.”

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.760
“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:19.230
“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes
she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:27.760
know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely.
“And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.360
in a while I go off on a spree and make a
fool of myself, but I always come back, and

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.160
in my heart I love her all the time.”

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:42.850
“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She
turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:51.050
lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn:
“Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:56.360
surprised that they didn’t treat you to
the story of that little spree.”

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.960
Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:07.130
“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said
earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:13.600
Just tell him the truth — that you never
loved him — and it’s all wiped out forever.”

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:22.540
She looked at him blindly. “Why — how
could I love him — possibly?”

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.510
“You never loved him.”

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:32.600
She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and
me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:38.670
at last what she was doing — and as though
she had never, all along, intended doing anything

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:44.880
at all. But it was done now. It was too late.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:50.810
“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible
reluctance.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:56.310
“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:57.800
“No.”

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:04.260
From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating
chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:11.220
“Not that day I carried you down from the
Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:16.310
was a husky tenderness in his tone.. .. “Daisy?”

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:23.990
“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold,
but the rancor was gone from it. She looked

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:31.770
at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said — but
her hand as she tried to light a cigarette

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:37.630
was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette
and the burning match on the carpet.

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:44.360
“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to
Gatsby. “I love you now — isn’t that

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:51.980
enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She
began to sob helplessly. “I did love him

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.830
once — but I loved you too.”

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.570
Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:03.000
“You loved me too?” he repeated.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:11.280
“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely.
“She didn’t know you were alive. Why — there’re

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.630
things between Daisy and me that you’ll
never know, things that neither of us can

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.620
ever forget.”

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.770
The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:28.450
“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted.
“She’s all excited now ——”

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:38.180
“Even alone I can’t say I never loved
Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice. “It

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.590
wouldn’t be true.”

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:44.740
“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.880
She turned to her husband.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.920
“As if it mattered to you,” she said.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.290
“Of course it matters. I’m going to take
better care of you from now on.”

00:39:55.290 --> 00:40:00.170
“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby,
with a touch of panic. “You’re not going

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.520
to take care of her any more.”

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:09.700
“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide
and laughed. He could afford to control himself

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.110
now. “Why’s that?”

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.570
“Daisy’s leaving you.”

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:16.450
“Nonsense.”

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:21.080
“I am, though,” she said with a visible
effort.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:27.610
“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words
suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:32.610
not for a common swindler who’d have to
steal the ring he put on her finger.”

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:38.020
“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh,
please let’s get out.”

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.970
“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom.
“You’re one of that bunch that hangs around

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:48.320
with Meyer Wolfsheim — that much I happen
to know. I’ve made a little investigation

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.290
into your affairs — and I’ll carry it
further to-morrow.”

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:57.920
“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,”
said Gatsby steadily.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:04.050
“I found out what your ‘drug-stores’
were.” He turned to us and spoke rapidly.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:08.320
“He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of
side-street drug-stores here and in Chicago

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:14.560
and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That’s
one of his little stunts. I picked him for

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.130
a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and
I wasn’t far wrong.”

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:23.780
“What about it?” said Gatsby politely.
“I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.650
too proud to come in on it.”

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:30.500
“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t
you? You let him go to jail for a month over

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:35.650
in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter
on the subject of you.”

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:41.330
“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad
to pick up some money, old sport.”

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:49.080
“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!”
cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. “Walter

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:54.690
could have you up on the betting laws too,
but Wolfsheim scared him into shutting his

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.410
mouth.”

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:04.290
That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was
back again in Gatsby’s face.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:10.380
“That drug-store business was just small
change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:15.080
got something on now that Walter’s afraid
to tell me about.”

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:22.650
I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified
between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan,

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:28.480
who had begun to balance an invisible but
absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:34.610
I turned back to Gatsby — and was startled
at his expression. He looked — and this

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:41.980
is said in all contempt for the babbled slander
of his garden — as if he had “killed a

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:50.320
man.” For a moment the set of his face could
be described in just that fantastic way.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.390
It passed, and he began to talk excitedly
to Daisy, denying everything, defending his

00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:01.170
name against accusations that had not been
made. But with every word she was drawing

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:07.860
further and further into herself, so he gave
that up, and only the dead dream fought on

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:15.630
as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch
what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily,

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:21.050
undespairingly, toward that lost voice across
the room.

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:23.400
The voice begged again to go.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.080
“please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:34.680
Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions,
whatever courage, she had had, were definitely

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.910
gone.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:44.240
“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom.
“In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:51.320
She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted
with magnanimous scorn.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:44:00.870
“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he
realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.940
is over.”

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:11.980
They were gone, without a word, snapped out,
made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:16.110
from our pity.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:21.500
After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping
the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.450
“Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?”

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.520
I didn’t answer.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.430
“Nick?” He asked again.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:32.670
“What?”

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.140
“Want any?”

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:41.810
“No . . . I just remembered that to-day’s
my birthday.”

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:51.830
I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous,
menacing road of a new decade.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:57.680
It was seven o’clock when we got into the
coupe with him and started for Long Island.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:04.040
Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing,
but his voice was as remote from Jordan and

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:11.780
me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or
the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:17.000
sympathy has its limits, and we were content
to let all their tragic arguments fade with

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:25.260
the city lights behind. Thirty — the promise
of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:33.680
of single men to know, a thinning brief-case
of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:40.000
Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too
wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.490
age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge
her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:53.260
shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty
died away with the reassuring pressure of

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.620
her hand.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.440
So we drove on toward death through the cooling
twilight.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:07.060
The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee
joint beside the ashheaps was the principal

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:13.470
witness at the inquest. He had slept through
the heat until after five, when he strolled

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:19.850
over to the garage, and found George Wilson
sick in his office — really sick, pale as

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:27.190
his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis
advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused,

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:31.620
saying that he’d miss a lot of business
if he did. While his neighbor was trying to

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.560
persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:42.340
“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,”
explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:47.860
to stay there till the day after to-morrow,
and then we’re going to move away.”

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:53.030
Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors
for four years, and Wilson had never seemed

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:59.540
faintly capable of such a statement. Generally
he was one of these worn-out men: when he

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:04.630
wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the
doorway and stared at the people and the cars

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:11.180
that passed along the road. When any one spoke
to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable,

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:16.600
colorless way. He was his wife’s man and
not his own.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.110
So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what
had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:26.980
word — instead he began to throw curious,
suspicious glances at his visitor and ask

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:33.000
him what he’d been doing at certain times
on certain days. Just as the latter was getting

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.010
uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound
for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:44.570
opportunity to get away, intending to come
back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:50.500
forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside
again, a little after seven, he was reminded

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:55.880
of the conversation because he heard Mrs.
Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, down-stairs

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.040
in the garage.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:04.520
“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw
me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:09.780
A moment later she rushed out into the dusk,
waving her hands and shouting — before he

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:14.180
could move from his door the business was
over.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:20.050
The “death car,” as the newspapers called
it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:26.140
darkness, wavered tragically for a moment,
and then disappeared around the next bend.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:30.210
Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its color
— he told the first policeman that it was

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:35.920
light green. The other car, the one going
toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:42.560
beyond, and its driver hurried back to where
Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished,

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:48.250
knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark
blood with the dust.

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:53.310
Michaelis and this man reached her first,
but when they had torn open her shirtwaist,

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:58.840
still damp with perspiration, they saw that
her left breast was swinging loose like a

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:05.030
flap, and there was no need to listen for
the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:09.730
and ripped at the corners, as though she had
choked a little in giving up the tremendous

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:14.240
vitality she had stored so long.

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:19.900
We saw the three or four automobiles and the
crowd when we were still some distance away.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:25.860
“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll
have a little business at last.”

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:31.580
He slowed down, but still without any intention
of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:36.130
hushed, intent faces of the people at the
garage door made him automatically put on

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:37.270
the brakes.

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:42.300
“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully,
“just a look.”

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:49.480
I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound
which issued incessantly from the garage,

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:54.420
a sound which as we got out of the coupe and
walked toward the door resolved itself into

00:49:54.420 --> 00:50:00.030
the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and
over in a gasping moan.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:05.060
“There’s some bad trouble here,” said
Tom excitedly.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.380
He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a
circle of heads into the garage, which was

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:15.730
lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire
basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:20.910
in his throat, and with a violent thrusting
movement of his powerful arms pushed his way

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:21.920
through.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:28.220
The circle closed up again with a running
murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:34.160
I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals
deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.980
suddenly inside.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:41.770
Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket,
and then in another blanket, as though she

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:47.940
suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay
on a work-table by the wall, and Tom, with

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:54.960
his back to us, was bending over it, motionless.
Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking

00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:01.260
down names with much sweat and correction
in a little book. At first I couldn’t find

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.859
the source of the high, groaning words that
echoed clamorously through the bare garage

00:51:05.859 --> 00:51:11.970
— then I saw Wilson standing on the raised
threshold of his office, swaying back and

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:19.000
forth and holding to the doorposts with both
hands. Some man was talking to him in a low

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.320
voice and attempting, from time to time, to
lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:30.620
heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly
from the swinging light to the laden table

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:37.080
by the wall, and then jerk back to the light
again, and he gave out incessantly his high,

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.990
horrible call:

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:49.480
“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! oh, Ga-od!
oh, my Ga-od!”

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.990
Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk
and, after staring around the garage with

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:59.730
glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent
remark to the policeman.

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:04.880
“M-a-y-,” the policeman was saying, “-o
——”

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:09.980
“No, r-,” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o
——”

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:14.230
“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:17.200
“r” said the policeman, “o ——”

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:17.970
“g ——”

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:24.860
“g ——” He looked up as Tom’s broad
hand fell sharply on his shoulder. “What

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.890
you want, fella?”

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:30.380
“What happened? — that’s what I want
to know.”

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:34.940
“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.870
“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:43.300
“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t
even stopus car.”

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:48.990
“There was two cars,” said Michaelis,
“one comin’, one goin’, see?”

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:52.210
“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:58.690
“One goin’ each way. Well, she.”—
his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:04.630
half way and fell to his side ——” she
ran out there an’ the one comin’ from

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:08.600
N’york knock right into her, goin’ thirty
or forty miles an hour.”

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.560
“What’s the name of this place here?”
demanded the officer.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.880
“Hasn’t got any name.”

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.570
A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:24.350
“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big
yellow car. New.”

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:27.260
“See the accident?” asked the policeman.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:34.040
“No, but the car passed me down the road,
going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:41.310
“Come here and let’s have your name. Look
out now. I want to get his name.”

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:46.060
Some words of this conversation must have
reached Wilson, swaying in the office door,

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:50.330
for suddenly a new theme found voice among
his gasping cries:

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:58.550
“You don’t have to tell me what kind of
car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”

00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:04.850
Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back
of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:09.390
walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing
in front of him, seized him firmly by the

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:10.820
upper arms.

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:17.250
“You’ve got to pull yourself together,”
he said with soothing gruffness.

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:23.920
Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started
up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.640
to his knees had not Tom held him upright.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:32.990
“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little.
“I just got here a minute ago, from New

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:39.290
York. I was bringing you that coupe we’ve
been talking about. That yellow car I was

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:46.670
driving this afternoon wasn’t mine — do
you hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:51.110
Only the negro and I were near enough to hear
what he said, but the policeman caught something

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:54.540
in the tone and looked over with truculent
eyes.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:58.170
“What’s all that?” he demanded.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:04.080
“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his
head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:10.890
body. “He says he knows the car that did
it . . . it was a yellow car.”

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:15.190
Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look
suspiciously at Tom.

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:17.260
“And what color’s your car?”

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:21.460
“It’s a blue car, a coupe.”

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.420
“We’ve come straight from New York,”
I said.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:29.290
Some one who had been driving a little behind
us confirmed this, and the policeman turned

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:30.530
away.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:35.920
“Now, if you’ll let me have that name
again correct ——” Picking up Wilson

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:41.270
like a doll, Tom carried him into the office,
set him down in a chair, and came back.

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:48.960
“If somebody’ll come here and sit with
him,” he snapped authoritatively. He watched

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:54.050
while the two men standing closest glanced
at each other and went unwillingly into the

00:55:54.050 --> 00:56:00.570
room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came
down the single step, his eyes avoiding the

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:07.810
table. As he passed close to me he whispered:
“Let’s get out.”

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:12.380
Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms
breaking the way, we pushed through the still

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:18.230
gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,
case in hand, who had been sent for in wild

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:21.550
hope half an hour ago.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:26.950
Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the
bend — then his foot came down hard, and

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:33.940
the coupe raced along through the night. In
a little while I heard a low husky sob, and

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.290
saw that the tears were overflowing down his
face.

00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:46.260
“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.
“He didn’t even stop his car.”

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:52.190
The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward
us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:56.570
beside the porch and looked up at the second
floor, where two windows bloomed with light

00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:58.040
among the vines.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:04.540
“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out
of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:10.680
“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg,
Nick. There’s nothing we can do to-night.”

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:18.960
A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely,
and with decision. As we walked across the

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:24.770
moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed
of the situation in a few brisk phrases.

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:29.290
“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you
home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan

00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:34.270
better go in the kitchen and have them get
you some supper — if you want any.” He

00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:37.590
opened the door. “Come in.”

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:44.550
“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d
order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:46.390
Jordan put her hand on my arm.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.310
“Won’t you come in, Nick?”

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:51.880
“No, thanks.”

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:57.800
I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to
be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment

00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:58.310
more.

00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:01.360
“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:07.640
I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had
enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:13.320
that included Jordan too. She must have seen
something of this in my expression, for she

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:18.880
turned abruptly away and ran up the porch
steps into the house. I sat down for a few

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.910
minutes with my head in my hands, until I
heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:29.760
voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly
down the drive away from the house, intending

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.310
to wait by the gate.

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:36.850
I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard
my name and Gatsby stepped from between two

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:42.960
bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty
weird by that time, because I could think

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:47.890
of nothing except the luminosity of his pink
suit under the moon.

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:52.750
“What are you doing?” I inquired.

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:56.070
“Just standing here, old sport.”

00:58:56.070 --> 00:59:02.010
Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation.
For all I knew he was going to rob the house

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:08.840
in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised
to see sinister faces, the faces of ‘Wolfsheim’s

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:12.030
people,’ behind him in the dark shrubbery.

00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:17.740
“Did you see any trouble on the road?”
he asked after a minute.

00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:19.390
“Yes.”

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:20.640
He hesitated.

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.880
“Was she killed?”

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.730
“Yes.”

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:31.460
“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so.
It’s better that the shock should all come

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.410
at once. She stood it pretty well.”

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:39.300
He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the
only thing that mattered.

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:44.380
“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he
went on, “and left the car in my garage.

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:49.110
I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course
I can’t be sure.”

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:54.950
I disliked him so much by this time that I
didn’t find it necessary to tell him he

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:56.140
was wrong.

00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:59.640
“Who was the woman?” he inquired.

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:07.800
“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the
garage. How the devil did it happen?”

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:16.500
“Well, I tried to swing the wheel ——” He
broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.390
“Was Daisy driving?”

01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:26.350
“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but
of course I’ll say I was. You see, when

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:31.470
we left New York she was very nervous and
she thought it would steady her to drive — and

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:37.500
this woman rushed out at us just as we were
passing a car coming the other way. It all

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:42.910
happened in a minute, but it seemed to me
that she wanted to speak to us, thought we

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:49.470
were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy
turned away from the woman toward the other

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:55.070
car, and then she lost her nerve and turned
back. The second my hand reached the wheel

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:59.880
I felt the shock — it must have killed her
instantly.”

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.960
“It ripped her open ——”

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:10.300
“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced.
“Anyhow — Daisy stepped on it. I tried

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:15.380
to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I
pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.120
over into my lap and I drove on.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:24.550
“She’ll be all right to-morrow,” he
said presently. “I’m just going to wait

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:30.690
here and see if he tries to bother her about
that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:34.610
locked herself into her room, and if he tries
any brutality she’s going to turn the light

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:36.420
out and on again.”

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:41.830
“He won’t touch her,’ I said. “He’s
not thinking about her.”

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:44.060
“I don’t trust him, old sport.”

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:47.180
“How long are you going to wait?”

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.930
“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they
all go to bed.”

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:59.960
A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose
Tom found out that Daisy had been driving.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:06.960
He might think he saw a connection in it — he
might think anything. I looked at the house;

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.540
there were two or three bright windows down-stairs
and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.920
second floor.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:19.680
“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see
if there’s any sign of a commotion.”

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:24.400
I walked back along the border of the lawn,
traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:31.050
the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains
were open, and I saw that the room was empty.

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:35.490
Crossing the porch where we had dined that
June night three months before, I came to

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:41.660
a small rectangle of light which I guessed
was the pantry window. The blind was drawn,

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:45.060
but I found a rift at the sill.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:49.180
Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other
at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:54.800
fried chicken between them, and two bottles
of ale. He was talking intently across the

01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:01.619
table at her, and in his earnestness his hand
had fallen upon and covered her own. Once

01:03:01.619 --> 01:03:04.860
in a while she looked up at him and nodded
in agreement.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.780
They weren’t happy, and neither of them
had touched the chicken or the ale — and

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:16.640
yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was
an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:23.130
the picture, and anybody would have said that
they were conspiring together.

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:28.020
As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi
feeling its way along the dark road toward

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:32.810
the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had
left him in the drive.

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:36.850
“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:45.700
“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated.
“You’d better come home and get some sleep.”

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.330
He shook his head.

01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:55.260
“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to
bed. Good night, old sport.”

01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:00.960
He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned
back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house,

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:07.900
as though my presence marred the sacredness
of the vigil. So I walked away and left him

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:12.150
standing there in the moonlight — watching
over nothing.
