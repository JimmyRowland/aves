00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.970
Chapter 3

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.370
There was music from my neighbor’s house
through the summer nights. In his blue gardens

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.860
men and girls came and went like moths among
the whisperings and the champagne and the

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.390
stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched
his guests diving from the tower of his raft,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.439
or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach
while his two motor-boats slit the waters

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.399
of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts
of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.329
an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the
city between nine in the morning and long

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.170
past midnight, while his station wagon scampered
like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.829
And on Mondays eight servants, including an
extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.469
scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears,
repairing the ravages of the night before.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.760
Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons
arrived from a fruiterer in New York — every

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.000
Monday these same oranges and lemons left
his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.420
There was a machine in the kitchen which could
extract the juice of two hundred oranges in

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.630
half an hour if a little button was pressed
two hundred times by a butler’s thumb.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.770
At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers
came down with several hundred feet of canvas

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.640
and enough colored lights to make a Christmas
tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.000
tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre,
spiced baked hams crowded against salads of

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.079
harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys
bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.600
a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and
stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.079
so long forgotten that most of his female
guests were too young to know one from another.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.770
By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived,
no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.700
of oboes and trombones and saxophones and
viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.500
high drums. The last swimmers have come in
from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs;

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.910
the cars from New York are parked five deep
in the drive, and already the halls and salons

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.410
and verandas are gaudy with primary colors,
and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.440
beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in
full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.860
permeate the garden outside, until the air
is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.880
innuendo and introductions forgotten on the
spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.240
who never knew each other’s names.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.060
The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches
away from the sun, and now the orchestra is

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.560
playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera
of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.690
easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality,
tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.530
change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals,
dissolve and form in the same breath; already

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.250
there are wanderers, confident girls who weave
here and there among the stouter and more

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.630
stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment
the centre of a group, and then, excited with

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.870
triumph, glide on through the sea-change of
faces and voices and color under the constantly

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.720
changing light.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.380
Suddenly one of the gypsies, in trembling
opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.650
it down for courage and, moving her hands
like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.610
platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra
leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.290
and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous
news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.410
understudy from the Follies. The party has
begun.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.470
I believe that on the first night I went to
Gatsby’s house I was one of the few guests

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.530
who had actually been invited. People were
not invited — they went there. They got

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.359
into automobiles which bore them out to Long
Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.650
door. Once there they were introduced by somebody
who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.569
themselves according to the rules of behavior
associated with amusement parks. Sometimes

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.860
they came and went without having met Gatsby
at all, came for the party with a simplicity

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.139
of heart that was its own ticket of admission.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.270
I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in
a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.560
lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly
formal note from his employer: the honor would

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.050
be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would
attend his “little party” that night.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.650
He had seen me several times, and had intended
to call on me long before, but a peculiar

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:12.400
combination of circumstances had prevented
it — signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.749
Dressed up in white flannels I went over to
his lawn a little after seven, and wandered

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:22.699
around rather ill at ease among swirls and
eddies of people I didn’t know — though

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.860
here and there was a face I had noticed on
the commuting train. I was immediately struck

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.590
by the number of young Englishmen dotted about;
all well dressed, all looking a little hungry,

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:41.520
and all talking in low, earnest voices to
solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.139
that they were selling something: bonds or
insurance or automobiles. They were at least

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.340
agonizingly aware of the easy money in the
vicinity and convinced that it was theirs

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.310
for a few words in the right key.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.330
As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to
find my host, but the two or three people

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.039
of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at
me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.569
any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk
off in the direction of the cocktail table

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:16.749
— the only place in the garden where a single
man could linger without looking purposeless

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:18.529
and alone.

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:23.889
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from
sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.310
out of the house and stood at the head of
the marble steps, leaning a little backward

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.029
and looking with contemptuous interest down
into the garden.

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:38.039
Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach
myself to some one before I should begin to

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.539
address cordial remarks to the passers-by.

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:47.310
“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her.
My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.430
garden.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:54.990
“I thought you might be here,” she responded
absently as I came up. “I remembered you

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.789
lived next door to ——” She held my hand
impersonally, as a promise that she’d take

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:05.889
care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two
girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:07.759
at the foot of the steps.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:13.370
“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry
you didn’t win.”

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.150
That was for the golf tournament. She had
lost in the finals the week before.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.879
“You don’t know who we are,” said one
of the girls in yellow, “but we met you

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.430
here about a month ago.”

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:30.180
“You’ve dyed your hair since then,”
remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.949
had moved casually on and her remark was addressed
to the premature moon, produced like the supper,

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:43.009
no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With
Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine,

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:48.550
we descended the steps and sauntered about
the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.789
us through the twilight, and we sat down at
a table with the two girls in yellow and three

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:57.770
men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:03.749
“Do you come to these parties often?”
inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:10.279
“The last one was the one I met you at,”
answered the girl, in an alert confident voice.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:15.039
She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it
for you, Lucille?”

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:17.789
It was for Lucille, too.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:23.289
“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never
care what I do, so I always have a good time.

00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:30.020
When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair,
and he asked me my name and address — inside

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.340
of a week I got a package from Croirier’s
with a new evening gown in it.”

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.770
“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:44.280
“Sure I did. I was going to wear it to-night,
but it was too big in the bust and had to

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.580
be altered. It was gas blue with lavender
beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.320
“There’s something funny about a fellow
that’ll do a thing like that,” said the

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.300
other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any
trouble with anybody.”

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.440
“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.460
“Gatsby. Somebody told me ——”

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.820
The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.950
“Somebody told me they thought he killed
a man once.”

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:20.880
A thrill passed over all of us. The three
Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.220
“I don’t think it’s so much that,”
argued Lucille sceptically; “it’s more

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.840
that he was a German spy during the war.”

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.020
One of the men nodded in confirmation.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:38.030
“I heard that from a man who knew all about
him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.550
us positively.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:45.070
“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t
be that, because he was in the American army

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:51.510
during the war.” As our credulity switched
back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:57.630
“You look at him sometimes when he thinks
nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.620
a man.”

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:04.650
She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille
shivered. We all turned and looked around

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:11.400
for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic
speculation he inspired that there were whispers

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.460
about him from those who found little that
it was necessary to whisper about in this

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.810
world.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.850
The first supper — there would be another
one after midnight — was now being served,

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.950
and Jordan invited me to join her own party,
who were spread around a table on the other

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:34.890
side of the garden. There were three married
couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.830
undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and
obviously under the impression that sooner

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:46.770
or later Jordan was going to yield him up
her person to a greater or lesser degree.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:52.890
Instead of rambling, this party had preserved
a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:58.470
the function of representing the staid nobility
of the country-side — East Egg condescending

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.920
to West Egg, and carefully on guard against
its spectroscopic gayety.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:10.870
“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after
a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.720
“This is much too polite for me.”

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.350
We got up, and she explained that we were
going to find the host: I had never met him,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:25.620
she said, and it was making me uneasy. The
undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.350
way.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:33.060
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded,
but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:38.990
him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t
on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:44.870
door, and walked into a high Gothic library,
panelled with carved English oak, and probably

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.280
transported complete from some ruin overseas.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:55.220
A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed
spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:01.250
the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady
concentration at the shelves of books. As

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.550
we entered he wheeled excitedly around and
examined Jordan from head to foot.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.360
“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.720
“About what?” He waved his hand toward
the book-shelves.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:23.190
“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t
bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.950
real.”

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.470
“The books?”

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.990
He nodded.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:34.550
“Absolutely real — have pages and everything.
I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:43.500
Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real.
Pages and — Here! Lemme show you.”

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.070
Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed
to the bookcases and returned with Volume

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.670
One of the “Stoddard Lectures.”

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:58.690
“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s
a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:08.510
me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s
a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism!

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:19.710
Knew when to stop, too — didn’t cut the
pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.200
He snatched the book from me and replaced
it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.520
one brick was removed the whole library was
liable to collapse.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:36.540
“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or
did you just come? I was brought. Most people

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.000
were brought.”

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.100
Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully,
without answering.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:49.670
“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,”
he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:56.410
you know her? I met her somewhere last night.
I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.630
I thought it might sober me up to sit in a
library.”

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.010
“Has it?”

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:11.690
“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet.
I’ve only been here an hour. Did I tell

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.530
you about the books? They’re real. They’re
——”

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:23.420
“You told us.” We shook hands with him
gravely and went back outdoors.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.970
There was dancing now on the canvas in the
garden; old men pushing young girls backward

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:36.370
in eternal graceless circles, superior couples
holding each other tortuously, fashionably,

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:41.860
and keeping in the corners — and a great
number of single girls dancing individualistically

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:48.830
or relieving the orchestra for a moment of
the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:55.010
the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor
had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.840
had sung in jazz, and between the numbers
people were doing “stunts” all over the

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:07.190
garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter
rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:13.820
twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow,
did a baby act in costume, and champagne was

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:20.360
served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls.
The moon had risen higher, and floating in

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:26.440
the Sound was a triangle of silver scales,
trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.500
of the banjoes on the lawn.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.740
I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting
at a table with a man of about my age and

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:41.530
a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the
slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:47.030
I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two
finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:54.070
changed before my eyes into something significant,
elemental, and profound.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:58.290
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked
at me and smiled.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:04.720
“Your face is familiar,” he said, politely.
“Weren’t you in the Third Division during

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.750
the war?”

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.550
“Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-gun
Battalion.”

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:16.110
“I was in the Seventh Infantry until June
nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.880
before.”

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:24.180
We talked for a moment about some wet, gray
little villages in France. Evidently he lived

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.610
in this vicinity, for he told me that he had
just bought a hydroplane, and was going to

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.410
try it out in the morning.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:35.470
“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near
the shore along the Sound.”

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.550
“What time?”

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.140
“Any time that suits you best.”

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.420
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his
name when Jordan looked around and smiled.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.850
“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:55.510
“Much better.” I turned again to my new
acquaintance. “This is an unusual party

00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:00.540
for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I
live over there ——” I waved my hand

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.459
at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and
this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:10.629
an invitation.” For a moment he looked at
me as if he failed to understand.

00:17:10.629 --> 00:17:14.279
“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:18.689
“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your
pardon.”

00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:25.350
“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid
I’m not a very good host.”

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:32.179
He smiled understandingly — much more than
understandingly. It was one of those rare

00:17:32.179 --> 00:17:39.370
smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance
in it, that you may come across four or five

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:47.700
times in life. It faced — or seemed to face
— the whole external world for an instant,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:55.610
and then concentrated on you with an irresistible
prejudice in your favor. It understood you

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:02.149
just so far as you wanted to be understood,
believed in you as you would like to believe

00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:08.350
in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely
the impression of you that, at your best,

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:16.600
you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point
it vanished — and I was looking at an elegant

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:23.840
young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty,
whose elaborate formality of speech just missed

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:30.720
being absurd. Some time before he introduced
himself I’d got a strong impression that

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.509
he was picking his words with care.

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:39.100
Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified
himself, a butler hurried toward him with

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:44.269
the information that Chicago was calling him
on the wire. He excused himself with a small

00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:47.539
bow that included each of us in turn.

00:18:47.539 --> 00:18:53.990
“If you want anything just ask for it, old
sport,” he urged me. “Excuse me. I will

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.019
rejoin you later.”

00:18:57.019 --> 00:19:03.019
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan
— constrained to assure her of my surprise.

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:08.759
I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a
florid and corpulent person in his middle

00:19:08.759 --> 00:19:09.389
years.

00:19:09.389 --> 00:19:12.549
“Who is he?” I demanded.

00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:14.679
“Do you know?”

00:19:14.679 --> 00:19:17.970
“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.799
“Where is he from, I mean? And what does
he do?”

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:29.190
“Now you’re started on the subject,”
she answered with a wan smile. “Well, he

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:36.029
told me once he was an Oxford man.” A dim
background started to take shape behind him,

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:38.999
but at her next remark it faded away.

00:19:38.999 --> 00:19:41.620
“However, I don’t believe it.”

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:49.279
“Why not?” “I don’t know,” she insisted,
“I just don’t think he went there.”

00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:54.159
Something in her tone reminded me of the other
girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:59.740
had the effect of stimulating my curiosity.
I would have accepted without question the

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:05.409
information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps
of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of

00:20:05.409 --> 00:20:12.100
New York. That was comprehensible. But young
men didn’t — at least in my provincial

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:18.700
inexperience I believed they didn’t — drift
coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.159
Long Island Sound.

00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:26.899
“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said
Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane

00:20:26.899 --> 00:20:34.340
distaste for the concrete. “And I like large
parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.429
there isn’t any privacy.”

00:20:37.429 --> 00:20:42.179
There was the boom of a bass drum, and the
voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:45.129
above the echolalia of the garden.

00:20:45.129 --> 00:20:51.210
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At
the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:58.090
play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff’s latest
work, which attracted so much attention at

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:05.499
Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers,
you know there was a big sensation.” He

00:21:05.499 --> 00:21:13.309
smiled with jovial condescension, and added:
“Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody

00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:13.879
laughed.

00:21:13.879 --> 00:21:23.019
“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily,
“as Vladimir Tostoff’s Jazz History of

00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:24.840
the World.”

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:31.669
The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition
eluded me, because just as it began my eyes

00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:37.440
fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble
steps and looking from one group to another

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:44.769
with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn
attractively tight on his face and his short

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:51.049
hair looked as though it were trimmed every
day. I could see nothing sinister about him.

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:56.169
I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking
helped to set him off from his guests, for

00:21:56.169 --> 00:22:01.929
it seemed to me that he grew more correct
as the fraternal hilarity increased. When

00:22:01.929 --> 00:22:06.710
the Jazz History of the World was over, girls
were putting their heads on men’s shoulders

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:13.740
in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning
backward playfully into men’s arms, even

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:19.720
into groups, knowing that some one would arrest
their falls — but no one swooned backward

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:27.269
on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s
shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed

00:22:27.269 --> 00:22:30.279
with Gatsby’s head for one link.

00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:32.490
“I beg your pardon.”

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.289
Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside
us.

00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:41.279
“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your
pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:42.970
to you alone.”

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.019
“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.

00:22:46.019 --> 00:22:47.730
“Yes, madame.”

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:53.590
She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at
me in astonishment, and followed the butler

00:22:53.590 --> 00:23:00.519
toward the house. I noticed that she wore
her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports

00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:05.999
clothes — there was a jauntiness about her
movements as if she had first learned to walk

00:23:05.999 --> 00:23:11.570
upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:17.990
I was alone and it was almost two. For some
time confused and intriguing sounds had issued

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:24.080
from a long, many-windowed room which overhung
the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.450
who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation
with two chorus girls, and who implored me

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:35.340
to join him, I went inside.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.720
The large room was full of people. One of
the girls in yellow was playing the piano,

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:46.470
and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young
lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:50.919
She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and
during the course of her song she had decided,

00:23:50.919 --> 00:23:56.649
ineptly, that everything was very, very sad
— she was not only singing, she was weeping

00:23:56.649 --> 00:24:03.360
too. Whenever there was a pause in the song
she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.229
then took up the lyric again in a quavering
soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks

00:24:09.229 --> 00:24:15.299
— not freely, however, for when they came
into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:22.220
they assumed an inky color, and pursued the
rest of their way in slow black rivulets.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.720
A humorous suggestion was made that she sing
the notes on her face, whereupon she threw

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:33.059
up her hands, sank into a chair, and went
off into a deep vinous sleep.

00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:39.739
“She had a fight with a man who says he’s
her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow.

00:24:39.739 --> 00:24:46.019
I looked around. Most of the remaining women
were now having fights with men said to be

00:24:46.019 --> 00:24:52.110
their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the
quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:57.869
dissension. One of the men was talking with
curious intensity to a young actress, and

00:24:57.869 --> 00:25:03.759
his wife, after attempting to laugh at the
situation in a dignified and indifferent way,

00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:09.489
broke down entirely and resorted to flank
attacks — at intervals she appeared suddenly

00:25:09.489 --> 00:25:16.169
at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:
“You promised!” into his ear.

00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:22.570
The reluctance to go home was not confined
to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:29.879
by two deplorably sober men and their highly
indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing

00:25:29.879 --> 00:25:32.710
with each other in slightly raised voices.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:37.029
“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time
he wants to go home.”

00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:39.980
“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.600
“We’re always the first ones to leave.”

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.259
“So are we.”

00:25:44.259 --> 00:25:50.739
“Well, we’re almost the last to-night,”
said one of the men sheepishly. “The orchestra

00:25:50.739 --> 00:25:53.529
left half an hour ago.”

00:25:53.529 --> 00:25:59.009
In spite of the wives’ agreement that such
malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute

00:25:59.009 --> 00:26:05.739
ended in a short struggle, and both wives
were lifted, kicking, into the night.

00:26:05.739 --> 00:26:10.899
As I waited for my hat in the hall the door
of the library opened and Jordan Baker and

00:26:10.899 --> 00:26:16.809
Gatsby came out together. He was saying some
last word to her, but the eagerness in his

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:21.710
manner tightened abruptly into formality as
several people approached him to say good-bye.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:27.700
Jordan’s party were calling impatiently
to her from the porch, but she lingered for

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.679
a moment to shake hands.

00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:37.320
“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,”
she whispered. “How long were we in there?”

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:44.649
“Why, about an hour.” “It was — simply
amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But

00:26:44.649 --> 00:26:52.190
I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am
tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:58.600
in my face: “Please come and see me. . . . Phone
book . . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:04.489
Howard . . . My aunt . . . ” She was hurrying
off as she talked — her brown hand waved

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:10.110
a jaunty salute as she melted into her party
at the door.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:15.159
Rather ashamed that on my first appearance
I had stayed so late, I joined the last of

00:27:15.159 --> 00:27:19.820
Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around
him. I wanted to explain that I’d hunted

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.369
for him early in the evening and to apologize
for not having known him in the garden.

00:27:24.369 --> 00:27:31.179
“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly.
“Don’t give it another thought, old sport.”

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:36.330
The familiar expression held no more familiarity
than the hand which reassuringly brushed my

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:41.379
shoulder. “And don’t forget we’re going
up in the hydroplane to-morrow morning, at

00:27:41.379 --> 00:27:42.779
nine o’clock.”

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:47.710
Then the butler, behind his shoulder: “Philadelphia
wants you on the ‘phone, sir.”

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:54.169
“All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll
be right there. . . . good night.”

00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:56.169
“Good night.”

00:27:56.169 --> 00:28:02.379
“Good night.” He smiled — and suddenly
there seemed to be a pleasant significance

00:28:02.379 --> 00:28:09.450
in having been among the last to go, as if
he had desired it all the time. “Good night,

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:13.239
old sport. . . . good night.”

00:28:13.239 --> 00:28:20.730
But as I walked down the steps I saw that
the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:26.759
from the door a dozen headlights illuminated
a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:33.100
beside the road, right side up, but violently
shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupe which

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:39.279
had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes
before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:43.690
for the detachment of the wheel, which was
now getting considerable attention from half

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:50.320
a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they
had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh,

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.429
discordant din from those in the rear had
been audible for some time, and added to the

00:28:55.429 --> 00:28:58.730
already violent confusion of the scene.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:03.470
A man in a long duster had dismounted from
the wreck and now stood in the middle of the

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:08.639
road, looking from the car to the tire and
from the tire to the observers in a pleasant,

00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:10.080
puzzled way.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:16.820
“See!” he explained. “It went in the
ditch.”

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:22.919
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him,
and I recognized first the unusual quality

00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:28.799
of wonder, and then the man — it was the
late patron of Gatsby’s library.

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:31.019
“How’d it happen?”

00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:32.440
He shrugged his shoulders.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.889
“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,”
he said decisively.

00:29:37.889 --> 00:29:46.369
“But how did it happen? Did you run into
the wall?” “Don’t ask me,” said Owl

00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:53.239
Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.
“I know very little about driving — next

00:29:53.239 --> 00:29:57.119
to nothing. It happened, and that’s all
I know.”

00:29:57.119 --> 00:30:03.489
“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t
to try driving at night.”

00:30:03.489 --> 00:30:10.149
“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained
indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.”

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:13.350
An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.789
“Do you want to commit suicide?”

00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:22.929
“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad
driver and not even trying!”

00:30:22.929 --> 00:30:29.230
“You don’t understand,” explained the
criminal. “I wasn’t driving. There’s

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.830
another man in the car.”

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:38.279
The shock that followed this declaration found
voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:46.529
door of the coupe swung slowly open. The crowd
— it was now a crowd — stepped back involuntarily,

00:30:46.529 --> 00:30:54.119
and when the door had opened wide there was
a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part

00:30:54.119 --> 00:31:01.210
by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped
out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.139
ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.

00:31:06.139 --> 00:31:10.320
Blinded by the glare of the headlights and
confused by the incessant groaning of the

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.249
horns, the apparition stood swaying for a
moment before he perceived the man in the

00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:16.149
duster.

00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:24.570
“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly.
“Did we run outa gas?”

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.419
“Look!”

00:31:25.419 --> 00:31:31.549
Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated
wheel — he stared at it for a moment, and

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:36.299
then looked upward as though he suspected
that it had dropped from the sky.

00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:39.970
“It came off,” some one explained.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:41.429
He nodded.

00:31:41.429 --> 00:31:46.489
“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”

00:31:46.489 --> 00:31:53.169
A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening
his shoulders, he remarked in a determined

00:31:53.169 --> 00:31:54.450
voice:

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:59.309
“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line
station?”

00:31:59.309 --> 00:32:03.989
At least a dozen men, some of them little
better off than he was, explained to him that

00:32:03.989 --> 00:32:08.580
wheel and car were no longer joined by any
physical bond.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:13.820
“Back out,” he suggested after a moment.
“Put her in reverse.”

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.070
“But the wheel’s off!”

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.509
He hesitated.

00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:23.119
“No harm in trying,” he said.

00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:28.309
The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo
and I turned away and cut across the lawn

00:32:28.309 --> 00:32:36.009
toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer
of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house,

00:32:36.009 --> 00:32:41.470
making the night fine as before, and surviving
the laughter and the sound of his still glowing

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:48.340
garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow
now from the windows and the great doors,

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:54.399
endowing with complete isolation the figure
of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand

00:32:54.399 --> 00:33:01.249
up in a formal gesture of farewell.

00:33:01.249 --> 00:33:05.899
Reading over what I have written so far, I
see I have given the impression that the events

00:33:05.899 --> 00:33:12.399
of three nights several weeks apart were all
that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were

00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:18.369
merely casual events in a crowded summer,
and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely

00:33:18.369 --> 00:33:21.539
less than my personal affairs.

00:33:21.539 --> 00:33:27.159
Most of the time I worked. In the early morning
the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried

00:33:27.159 --> 00:33:33.049
down the white chasms of lower New York to
the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks

00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:38.200
and young bond-salesmen by their first names,
and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:44.320
on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes
and coffee. I even had a short affair with

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.529
a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked
in the accounting department, but her brother

00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:55.049
began throwing mean looks in my direction,
so when she went on her vacation in July I

00:33:55.049 --> 00:33:57.679
let it blow quietly away.

00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:02.809
I took dinner usually at the Yale Club — for
some reason it was the gloomiest event of

00:34:02.809 --> 00:34:07.729
my day — and then I went up-stairs to the
library and studied investments and securities

00:34:07.729 --> 00:34:13.539
for a conscientious hour. There were generally
a few rioters around, but they never came

00:34:13.539 --> 00:34:18.700
into the library, so it was a good place to
work. After that, if the night was mellow,

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:24.980
I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old
Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.450
the Pennsylvania Station.

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:33.030
I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous
feel of it at night, and the satisfaction

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:38.089
that the constant flicker of men and women
and machines gives to the restless eye. I

00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:43.099
liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out
romantic women from the crowd and imagine

00:34:43.099 --> 00:34:47.429
that in a few minutes I was going to enter
into their lives, and no one would ever know

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:53.599
or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed
them to their apartments on the corners of

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:59.010
hidden streets, and they turned and smiled
back at me before they faded through a door

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:07.920
into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan
twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.280
and felt it in others — poor young clerks
who loitered in front of windows waiting until

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:19.109
it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner
— young clerks in the dusk, wasting the

00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:23.720
most poignant moments of night and life.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.160
Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes
of the Forties were five deep with throbbing

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:35.059
taxi-cabs, bound for the theatre district,
I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned

00:35:35.059 --> 00:35:40.809
together in the taxis as they waited, and
voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard

00:35:40.809 --> 00:35:48.460
jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible
70 gestures inside. Imagining that I, too,

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:55.089
was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their
intimate excitement, I wished them well.

00:35:55.089 --> 00:36:00.329
For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker,
and then in midsummer I found her again. At

00:36:00.329 --> 00:36:05.010
first I was flattered to go places with her,
because she was a golf champion, and every

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:12.920
one knew her name. Then it was something more.
I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:19.960
sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty
face that she turned to the world concealed

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:25.760
something — most affectations conceal something
eventually, even though they don’t in the

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:32.740
beginning — and one day I found what it
was. When we were on a house-party together

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:38.520
up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out
in the rain with the top down, and then lied

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.349
about it — and suddenly I remembered the
story about her that had eluded me that night

00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:50.790
at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament
there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:57.579
— a suggestion that she had moved her ball
from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The

00:36:57.579 --> 00:37:03.789
thing approached the proportions of a scandal
— then died away. A caddy retracted his

00:37:03.789 --> 00:37:09.130
statement, and the only other witness admitted
that he might have been mistaken. The incident

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:13.390
and the name had remained together in my mind.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:19.220
Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever,
shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:26.220
she felt safer on a plane where any divergence
from a code would be thought impossible. She

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:33.970
was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able
to endure being at a disadvantage and, given

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:39.369
this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun
dealing in subterfuges when she was very young

00:37:39.369 --> 00:37:45.660
in order to keep that cool, insolent smile
turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.170
of her hard, jaunty body.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:54.509
It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in
a woman is a thing you never blame deeply

00:37:54.509 --> 00:38:02.329
— I was casually sorry, and then I forgot.
It was on that same house party that we had

00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:08.220
a curious conversation about driving a car.
It started because she passed so close to

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:13.089
some workmen that our fender flicked a button
on one man’s coat.

00:38:13.089 --> 00:38:17.910
“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested.
“Either you ought to be more careful, or

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.849
you oughtn’t to drive at all.”

00:38:20.849 --> 00:38:22.470
“I am careful.”

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.099
“No, you’re not.”

00:38:24.099 --> 00:38:26.740
“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.039
“What’s that got to do with it?”

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:33.250
“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted.
“It takes two to make an accident.”

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:37.460
“Suppose you met somebody just as careless
as yourself.”

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:45.180
“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I
hate careless people. That’s why I like

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:45.750
you.”

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:51.780
Her gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight
ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:59.450
relations, and for a moment I thought I loved
her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:05.670
rules that act as brakes on my desires, and
I knew that first I had to get myself definitely

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:12.470
out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing
letters once a week and signing them: “Love,

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:18.440
Nick,” and all I could think of was how,
when that certain girl played tennis, a faint

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:25.619
mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper
lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding

00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:30.900
that had to be tactfully broken off before
I was free.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:36.770
Every one suspects himself of at least one
of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine:

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:40.079
I am one of the few honest people that I have
ever known.
