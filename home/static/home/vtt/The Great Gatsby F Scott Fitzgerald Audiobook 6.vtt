00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.830
Chapter 6

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.930
About this time an ambitious young reporter
from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.270
door and asked him if he had anything to say.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.050
“Anything to say about what?” inquired
Gatsby politely.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.859
“Why — any statement to give out.”

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.569
It transpired after a confused five minutes
that the man had heard Gatsby’s name around

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:32.860
his office in a connection which he either
wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.730
This was his day off and with laudable initiative
he had hurried out “to see.”

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.090
It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s
instinct was right. Gatsby’s notoriety,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.420
spread about by the hundreds who had accepted
his hospitality and so become authorities

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.170
on his past, had increased all summer until
he fell just short of being news. Contemporary

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.619
legends such as the “underground pipe-line
to Canada” attached themselves to him, and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.610
there was one persistent story that he didn’t
live in a house at all, but in a boat that

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.010
looked like a house and was moved secretly
up and down the Long Island shore. Just why

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.570
these inventions were a source of satisfaction
to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.540
to say.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.870
James Gatz — that was really, or at least
legally, his name. He had changed it at the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.500
age of seventeen and at the specific moment
that witnessed the beginning of his career

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.390
— when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor
over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.299
It was James Gatz who had been loafing along
the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.049
and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already
Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.830
out to the Tuolomee, and informed Cody that
a wind might catch him and break him up in

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.549
half an hour.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:11.060
I suppose he’d had the name ready for a
long time, even then. His parents were shiftless

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.610
and unsuccessful farm people — his imagination
had never really accepted them as his parents

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.340
at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West
Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.590
conception of himself. He was a son of God
— a phrase which, if it means anything,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.640
means just that — and he must be about His
Father’s business, the service of a vast,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.380
vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented
just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.569
boy would be likely to invent, and to this
conception he was faithful to the end.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.760
For over a year he had been beating his way
along the south shore of Lake Superior as

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.980
a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any
other capacity that brought him food and bed.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.709
His brown, hardening body lived naturally
through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.580
the bracing days. He knew women early, and
since they spoiled him he became contemptuous

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.069
of them, of young virgins because they were
ignorant, of the others because they were

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:25.300
hysterical about things which in his overwhelming
self-absorbtion he took for granted.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.989
But his heart was in a constant, turbulent
riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.239
haunted him in his bed at night. A universe
of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.830
his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand
and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.950
clothes upon the floor. Each night he added
to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.420
closed down upon some vivid scene with an
oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.640
provided an outlet for his imagination; they
were a satisfactory hint of the unreality

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.390
of reality, a promise that the rock of the
world was founded securely on a fairy’s

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.440
wing.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.060
An instinct toward his future glory had led
him, some months before, to the small Lutheran

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.110
college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota.
He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.180
ferocious indifference to the drums of his
destiny, to destiny itself, and despising

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.760
the janitor’s work with which he was to
pay his way through. Then he drifted back

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.960
to Lake Superior, and he was still searching
for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.930
yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.150
Cody was fifty years old then, a product of
the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.750
every rush for metal since seventy-five. The
transactions in Montana copper that made him

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.600
many times a millionaire found him physically
robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.440
and, suspecting this, an infinite number of
women tried to separate him from his money.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.780
The none too savory ramifications by which
Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.930
de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him
to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.250
the turgid sub-journalism of 1902. He had
been coasting along all too hospitable shores

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.080
for five years when he turned up as James
Gatz’s destiny at Little Girls Point.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.330
To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and
looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.350
all the beauty and glamour in the world. I
suppose he smiled at Cody — he had probably

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.639
discovered that people liked him when he smiled.
At any rate Cody asked him a few questions

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.160
(one of them elicited the brand new name)
and found that he was quick and extravagantly

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.460
ambitious. A few days later he took him to
Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.370
of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap.
And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.500
and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.550
He was employed in a vague personal capacity
— while he remained with Cody he was in

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.699
turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and
even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:27.570
lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be
about, and he provided for such contingencies

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:33.780
by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby.
The arrangement lasted five years, during

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.030
which the boat went three times around the
Continent. It might have lasted indefinitely

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.940
except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on
board one night in Boston and a week later

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.710
Dan Cody inhospitably died.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.560
I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s
bedroom, a gray, florid man with a hard, empty

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.400
face — the pioneer debauchee, who during
one phase of American life brought back to

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:07.430
the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of
the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.240
due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes
in the course of gay parties women used to

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.759
rub champagne into his hair; for himself he
formed the habit of letting liquor alone.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:25.460
And it was from Cody that he inherited money
— a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.830
He didn’t get it. He never understood the
legal device that was used against him, but

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.789
what remained of the millions went intact
to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:43.780
appropriate education; the vague contour of
Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.210
of a man.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.599
He told me all this very much later, but I’ve
put it down here with the idea of exploding

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:57.229
those first wild rumors about his antecedents,
which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:02.380
he told it to me at a time of confusion, when
I had reached the point of believing everything

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:09.169
and nothing about him. So I take advantage
of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak,

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:13.240
caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions
away.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.569
It was a halt, too, in my association with
his affairs. For several weeks I didn’t

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:23.669
see him or hear his voice on the phone — mostly
I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:29.270
and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile
aunt — but finally I went over to his house

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:35.139
one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there
two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:41.519
in for a drink. I was startled, naturally,
but the really surprising thing was that it

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.889
hadn’t happened before.

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:50.699
They were a party of three on horseback — Tom
and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:54.110
in a brown riding-habit, who had been there
previously.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:59.529
“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby,
standing on his porch. “I’m delighted

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:00.949
that you dropped in.”

00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:02.730
As though they cared!

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:09.569
“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.”
He walked around the room quickly, ringing

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:13.350
bells. “I’ll have something to drink for
you in just a minute.”

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:19.449
He was profoundly affected by the fact that
Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow

00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:24.869
until he had given them something, realizing
in a vague way that that was all they came

00:09:24.869 --> 00:09:31.819
for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade?
No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at

00:09:31.819 --> 00:09:33.839
all, thanks. . . . I’m sorry ——

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.879
“Did you have a nice ride?”

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:38.860
“Very good roads around here.”

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.319
“I suppose the automobiles ——”

00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:43.559
“Yeah.”

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:49.170
Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned
to Tom, who had accepted the introduction

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.339
as a stranger.

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:55.730
“I believe we’ve met somewhere before,
Mr. Buchanan.”

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:03.129
“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but
obviously not remembering. “So we did. I

00:10:03.129 --> 00:10:04.860
remember very well.”

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.019
“About two weeks ago.”

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:11.839
“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:16.160
“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby,
almost aggressively.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.970
“That so?”

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.350
Tom turned to me.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.249
“You live near here, Nick?”

00:10:22.249 --> 00:10:23.679
“Next door.”

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:25.110
“That so?”

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:31.199
Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation,
but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the

00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:37.170
woman said nothing either — until unexpectedly,
after two highballs, she became cordial.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:43.639
“We’ll all come over to your next party,
Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:44.139
say?”

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:47.769
“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:54.529
“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without
gratitude. “Well — think ought to be starting

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:55.089
home.”

00:10:55.089 --> 00:11:02.269
“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them.
He had control of himself now, and he wanted

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:07.939
to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you — why
don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t

00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:10.879
be surprised if some other people dropped
in from New York.”

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:18.160
“You come to supper with me,” said the
lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.”

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.809
This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:24.889
“Come along,” he said — but to her only.

00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:31.499
“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love
to have you. Lots of room.”

00:11:31.499 --> 00:11:36.889
Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted
to go, and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:39.160
had determined he shouldn’t.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.249
“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I
said.

00:11:44.249 --> 00:11:49.509
“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating
on Gatsby.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.399
Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her
ear.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:56.439
“We won’t be late if we start now,”
she insisted aloud.

00:11:56.439 --> 00:12:01.959
“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby.
“I used to ride in the army, but I’ve

00:12:01.959 --> 00:12:08.819
never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow
you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:14.470
The rest of us walked out on the porch, where
Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.410
aside.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:21.639
“My God, I believe the man’s coming,”
said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:22.689
want him?”

00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:25.029
“She says she does want him.”

00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:32.350
“She has a big dinner party and he won’t
know a soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:38.819
where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I
may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women

00:12:38.819 --> 00:12:46.119
run around too much these days to suit me.
They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:50.339
Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down
the steps and mounted their horses.

00:12:50.339 --> 00:12:57.790
“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re
late. We’ve got to go.” And then to me:

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.980
“Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:06.209
Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged
a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down

00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:12.559
the drive, disappearing under the August foliage
just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:16.739
in hand, came out the front door.

00:13:16.739 --> 00:13:22.470
Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running
around alone, for on the following Saturday

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:27.819
night he came with her to Gatsby’s party.
Perhaps his presence gave the evening its

00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:34.040
peculiar quality of oppressiveness — it
stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:40.600
parties that summer. There were the same people,
or at least the same sort of people, the same

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:47.850
profusion of champagne, the same many-colored,
many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:54.049
in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t
been there before. Or perhaps I had merely

00:13:54.049 --> 00:14:00.549
grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg
as a world complete in itself, with its own

00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:05.639
standards and its own great figures, second
to nothing because it had no consciousness

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:14.660
of being so, and now I was looking at it again,
through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:22.879
to look through new eyes at things upon which
you have expended your own powers of adjustment.

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:28.119
They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled
out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s

00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:31.529
voice was playing murmurous tricks in her
throat.

00:14:31.529 --> 00:14:35.720
“These things excite me so,” she whispered.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.689
“If you want to kiss me any time during
the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll

00:14:40.689 --> 00:14:46.519
be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention
my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:47.069
out green ——”

00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:50.499
“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.

00:14:50.499 --> 00:14:53.230
“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvelous
——”

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:57.689
“You must see the faces of many people you’ve
heard about.”

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:00.489
Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.

00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:06.489
“We don’t go around very much,” he said.
“In fact, I was just thinking I don’t

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.279
know a soul here.”

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:15.790
“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated
a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:23.220
who sat in state under a white plum tree.
Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:33.220
unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition
of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.910
“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:39.410
“The man bending over her is her director.”

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.929
He took them ceremoniously from group to group:

00:15:42.929 --> 00:15:49.259
“Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan ——” After
an instant’s hesitation he added: “the

00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:50.519
polo player.”

00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:55.439
“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not
me.”

00:15:55.439 --> 00:16:00.220
But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby,
for Tom remained “the polo player” for

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.359
the rest of the evening.

00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:08.100
“I’ve never met so many celebrities!”
Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that man — what

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.290
was his name? — with the sort of blue nose.”

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:15.040
Gatsby identified him, adding that he was
a small producer.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.249
“Well, I liked him anyhow.”

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:25.309
“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,”
said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look

00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:30.529
at all these famous people in — in oblivion.”

00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:37.009
Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being
surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot

00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:43.689
— I had never seen him dance before. Then
they sauntered over to my house and sat on

00:16:43.689 --> 00:16:49.819
the steps for half an hour, while at her request
I remained watchfully in the garden. “In

00:16:49.819 --> 00:16:56.160
case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained,
“or any act of God.”

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.970
Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were
sitting down to supper together. “Do you

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.329
mind if I eat with some people over here?”
he said. “A fellow’s getting off some

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:06.419
funny stuff.”

00:17:06.419 --> 00:17:14.600
“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and
if you want to take down any addresses here’s

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.699
my little gold pencil.” . . . she looked
around after a moment and told me the girl

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:26.250
was “common but pretty,” and I knew that
except for the half-hour she’d been alone

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:31.230
with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.929
We were at a particularly tipsy table. That
was my fault — Gatsby had been called to

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:42.630
the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people
only two weeks before. But what had amused

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.220
me then turned septic on the air now.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.299
“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”

00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:56.220
The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully,
to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.490
she sat up and opened her eyes.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.440
“Wha’?”

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.750
A massive and lethargic woman, who had been
urging Daisy to play golf with her at the

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.860
local club to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s
defence:

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:15.169
“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s
had five or six cocktails she always starts

00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:18.730
screaming like that. I tell her she ought
to leave it alone.”

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:25.679
“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused
hollowly.

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:32.700
“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc
Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.429
your help, Doc.’”

00:18:34.429 --> 00:18:41.059
“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said
another friend, without gratitude. “But

00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:44.870
you got her dress all wet when you stuck her
head in the pool.”

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:52.870
“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck
in a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.190
almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”

00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:01.039
“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered
Doctor Civet.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:08.909
“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker
violently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t

00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:12.230
let you operate on me!”

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:18.360
It was like that. Almost the last thing I
remember was standing with Daisy and watching

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.889
the moving-picture director and his Star.
They were still under the white plum tree

00:19:23.889 --> 00:19:31.630
and their faces were touching except for a
pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:37.980
to me that he had been very slowly bending
toward her all evening to attain this proximity,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:44.350
and even while I watched I saw him stoop one
ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:49.899
“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s
lovely.”

00:19:49.899 --> 00:19:59.200
But the rest offended her — and inarguably,
because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.840
She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented
“place” that Broadway had begotten upon

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.580
a Long Island fishing village — appalled
by its raw vigor that chafed under the old

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:17.950
euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that
herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:27.460
nothing to nothing. She saw something awful
in the very simplicity she failed to understand.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:32.580
I sat on the front steps with them while they
waited for their car. It was dark here in

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:38.799
front; only the bright door sent ten square
feet of light volleying out into the soft

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:46.200
black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against
a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:53.529
shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows,
who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.

00:20:53.529 --> 00:21:00.919
“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded
Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”

00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:05.289
“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.

00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:09.679
“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot
of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers,

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:10.919
you know.”

00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:14.320
“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.429
He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of
the drive crunched under his feet.

00:21:19.429 --> 00:21:25.399
“Well, he certainly must have strained himself
to get this menagerie together.”

00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:30.129
A breeze stirred the gray haze of Daisy’s
fur collar.

00:21:30.129 --> 00:21:36.049
“At least they’re more interesting than
the people we know,” she said with an effort.

00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:38.440
“You didn’t look so interested.”

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.549
“Well, I was.”

00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:44.080
Tom laughed and turned to me.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:51.169
“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that
girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”

00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:57.200
Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky,
rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:04.259
each word that it had never had before and
would never have again. When the melody rose,

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:10.799
her voice broke up sweetly, following it,
in a way contralto voices have, and each change

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:15.250
tipped out a little of her warm human magic
upon the air.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:22.169
“Lots of people come who haven’t been
invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:26.830
hadn’t been invited. They simply force their
way in and he’s too polite to object.”

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:33.820
“I’d like to know who he is and what he
does,” insisted Tom. “And I think I’ll

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.980
make a point of finding out.”

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:42.309
“I can tell you right now,” she answered.
“He owned some drug-stores, a lot of drug-stores.

00:22:42.309 --> 00:22:45.519
He built them up himself.”

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:48.600
The dilatory limousine came rolling up the
drive.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.049
“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.

00:22:53.049 --> 00:22:57.830
Her glance left me and sought the lighted
top of the steps, where Three O’clock in

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:04.480
the Morning, a neat, sad little waltz of that
year, was drifting out the open door. After

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.450
all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s
party there were romantic possibilities totally

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:17.220
absent from her world. What was it up there
in the song that seemed to be calling her

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:25.779
back inside? What would happen now in the
dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:32.029
guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare
and to be marvelled at, some authentically

00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:38.779
radiant young girl who with one fresh glance
at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter,

00:23:38.779 --> 00:23:45.659
would blot out those five years of unwavering
devotion.

00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:51.340
I stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me
to wait until he was free, and I lingered

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:56.580
in the garden until the inevitable swimming
party had run up, chilled and exalted, from

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:03.080
the black beach, until the lights were extinguished
in the guest-rooms overhead. When he came

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.480
down the steps at last the tanned skin was
drawn unusually tight on his face, and his

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.659
eyes were bright and tired.

00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:14.799
“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:16.690
“Of course she did.”

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:22.610
“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She
didn’t have a good time.”

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.490
He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable
depression.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:35.360
“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s
hard to make her understand.”

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.509
“You mean about the dance?”

00:24:38.509 --> 00:24:45.539
“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances
he had given with a snap of his fingers. “Old

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:50.159
sport, the dance is unimportant.”

00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:55.820
He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that
she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:02.029
you.” After she had obliterated four years
with that sentence they could decide upon

00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:07.499
the more practical measures to be taken. One
of them was that, after she was free, they

00:25:07.499 --> 00:25:12.700
were to go back to Louisville and be married
from her house — just as if it were five

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.860
years ago.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:24.029
“And she doesn’t understand,” he said.
“She used to be able to understand. We’d

00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.809
sit for hours ——”

00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:31.990
He broke off and began to walk up and down
a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.629
favors and crushed flowers.

00:25:34.629 --> 00:25:40.320
“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I
ventured. “You can’t repeat the past.”

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:48.470
“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously.
“Why of course you can!”

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:53.779
He looked around him wildly, as if the past
were lurking here in the shadow of his house,

00:25:53.779 --> 00:25:56.340
just out of reach of his hand.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:04.230
“I’m going to fix everything just the
way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:07.639
“She’ll see.”

00:26:07.639 --> 00:26:13.320
He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered
that he wanted to recover something, some

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:19.940
idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into
loving Daisy. His life had been confused and

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:25.970
disordered since then, but if he could once
return to a certain starting place and go

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:33.480
over it all slowly, he could find out what
that thing was. . . .

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:39.059
. . . One autumn night, five years before,
they had been walking down the street when

00:26:39.059 --> 00:26:43.610
the leaves were falling, and they came to
a place where there were no trees and the

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:50.749
sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped
here and turned toward each other. Now it

00:26:50.749 --> 00:26:56.289
was a cool night with that mysterious excitement
in it which comes at the two changes of the

00:26:56.289 --> 00:27:02.379
year. The quiet lights in the houses were
humming out into the darkness and there was

00:27:02.379 --> 00:27:08.610
a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of
the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:14.909
blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder
and mounted to a secret place above the trees

00:27:14.909 --> 00:27:21.779
— he could climb to it, if he climbed alone,
and once there he could suck on the pap of

00:27:21.779 --> 00:27:28.799
life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.

00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:35.559
His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s
white face came up to his own. He knew that

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:41.659
when he kissed this girl, and forever wed
his unutterable visions to her perishable

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:51.409
breath, his mind would never romp again like
the mind of God. So he waited, listening for

00:27:51.409 --> 00:28:00.179
a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had
been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her.

00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:10.240
At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him
like a flower and the incarnation was complete.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:16.710
Through all he said, even through his appalling
sentimentality, I was reminded of something

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:23.960
— an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost
words, that I had heard somewhere a long time

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:30.519
ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape
in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb

00:28:30.519 --> 00:28:37.230
man’s, as though there was more struggling
upon them than a wisp of startled air. But

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:52.419
they made no sound, and what I had almost
remembered was uncommunicable forever.
