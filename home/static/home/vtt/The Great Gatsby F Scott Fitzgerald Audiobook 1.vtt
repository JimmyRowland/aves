The Great Gatsby
F. Scott Fitzgerald

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.090
read by William hope

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.619
Then wear the gold hat, if that will move
her;

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.849
If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.710
Till she cry “Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing
lover,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.339
I must have you!”

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.449
The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.679
Chapter 1

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.470
In my younger and more vulnerable years my
father gave me some advice that I’ve been

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.970
turning over in my mind ever since.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.020
“Whenever you feel like criticizing any
one,” he told me, “just remember that

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.870
all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages that you’ve had.”

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.960
He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always
been unusually communicative in a reserved

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.760
way, and I understood that he meant a great
deal more than that. In consequence, I’m

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.510
inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit
that has opened up many curious natures to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.500
me and also made me the victim of not a few
veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.150
to detect and attach itself to this quality
when it appears in a normal person, and so

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:20.440
it came about that in college I was unjustly
accused of being a politician, because I was

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.380
privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown
men. Most of the confidences were unsought

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.950
— frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation,
or a hostile levity when I realized by some

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.729
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation
was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.280
revelations of young men, or at least the
terms in which they express them, are usually

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.790
plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.720
hope. I am still a little afraid of missing
something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.680
suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense
of the fundamental decencies is parcelled

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.629
out unequally at birth.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:17.439
And, after boasting this way of my tolerance,
I come to the admission that it has a limit.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.739
Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or
the wet marshes, but after a certain point

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.420
I don’t care what it’s founded on. When
I came back from the East last autumn I felt

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.409
that I wanted the world to be in uniform and
at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:44.519
no more riotous excursions with privileged
glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby,

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.999
the man who gives his name to this book, was
exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:59.829
everything for which I have an unaffected
scorn. If personality is an unbroken series

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:07.669
of successful gestures, then there was something
gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:13.629
to the promises of life, as if he were related
to one of those intricate machines that register

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.329
earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This
responsiveness had nothing to do with that

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.859
flabby impressionability which is dignified
under the name of the “creative temperament.”—

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:32.739
it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic
readiness such as I have never found in any

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:40.340
other person and which it is not likely I
shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.939
out all right at the end; it is what preyed
on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:56.480
of his dreams that temporarily closed out
my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.459
elations of men.

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.870
My family have been prominent, well-to-do
people in this Middle Western city for three

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.499
generations. The Carraways are something of
a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:16.870
descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but
the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.240
brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent
a substitute to the Civil War, and started

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.610
the wholesale hardware business that my father
carries on to-day.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.780
I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed
to look like him — with special reference

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.210
to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs
in father’s office. I graduated from New

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.039
Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century
after my father, and a little later I participated

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:51.729
in that delayed Teutonic migration known as
the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.990
so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead
of being the warm centre of the world, the

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.810
Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge
of the universe — so I decided to go East

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.000
and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew
was in the bond business, so I supposed it

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.759
could support one more single man. All my
aunts and uncles talked it over as if they

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:24.400
were choosing a prep school for me, and finally
said, “Why — ye — es,” with very grave,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.389
hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me
for a year, and after various delays I came

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.830
East, permanently, I thought, in the spring
of twenty-two.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.300
The practical thing was to find rooms in the
city, but it was a warm season, and I had

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.970
just left a country of wide lawns and friendly
trees, so when a young man at the office suggested

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.759
that we take a house together in a commuting
town, it sounded like a great idea. He found

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.650
the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow
at eighty a month, but at the last minute

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.030
the firm ordered him to Washington, and I
went out to the country alone. I had a dog

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.250
— at least I had him for a few days until
he ran away — and an old Dodge and a Finnish

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.180
woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast
and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.759
the electric stove.

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:23.610
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning
some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.740
me on the road.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.699
“How do you get to West Egg village?”
he asked helplessly.

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:39.180
I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely
no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.419
original settler. He had casually conferred
on me the freedom of the neighborhood.

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.430
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts
of leaves growing on the trees, just as things

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.879
grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction
that life was beginning over again with the

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:57.900
summer.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.919
There was so much to read, for one thing,
and so much fine health to be pulled down

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:09.990
out of the young breath-giving air. I bought
a dozen volumes on banking and credit and

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.280
investment securities, and they stood on my
shelf in red and gold like new money from

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.620
the mint, promising to unfold the shining
secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:28.300
knew. And I had the high intention of reading
many other books besides. I was rather literary

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.840
in college — one year I wrote a series of
very solemn and obvious editorials for the

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.969
“Yale News.”— and now I was going to
bring back all such things into my life and

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:47.249
become again that most limited of all specialists,
the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:55.870
an epigram — life is much more successfully
looked at from a single window, after all.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.629
It was a matter of chance that I should have
rented a house in one of the strangest communities

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:07.889
in North America. It was on that slender riotous
island which extends itself due east of New

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:13.499
York — and where there are, among other
natural curiosities, two unusual formations

00:08:13.499 --> 00:08:20.150
of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair
of enormous eggs, identical in contour and

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:26.340
separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out
into the most domesticated body of salt water

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:32.710
in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard
of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.540
ovals — like the egg in the Columbus story,
they are both crushed flat at the contact

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.130
end — but their physical resemblance must
be a source of perpetual confusion to the

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:49.140
gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a
more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.580
in every particular except shape and size.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:01.270
I lived at West Egg, the — well, the less
fashionable of the two, though this is a most

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:08.140
superficial tag to express the bizarre and
not a little sinister contrast between them.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.460
My house was at the very tip of the egg, only
fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:20.690
two huge places that rented for twelve or
fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.700
was a colossal affair by any standard — it
was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:34.380
in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking
new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:40.800
swimming pool, and more than forty acres of
lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.320
Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby,
it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:53.670
of that name. My own house was an eyesore,
but it was a small eyesore, and it had been

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.750
overlooked, so I had a view of the water,
a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:05.640
the consoling proximity of millionaires — all
for eighty dollars a month.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.000
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces
of fashionable East Egg glittered along the

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.910
water, and the history of the summer really
begins on the evening I drove over there to

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:21.840
have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy
was my second cousin once removed, and I’d

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.180
known Tom in college. And just after the war
I spent two days with them in Chicago.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:33.810
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,
had been one of the most powerful ends that

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:39.330
ever played football at New Haven — a national
figure in a way, one of those men who reach

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:46.890
such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one
that everything afterward savors of anti-climax.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.960
His family were enormously wealthy — even
in college his freedom with money was a matter

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.690
for reproach — but now he’d left Chicago
and come East in a fashion that rather took

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:04.760
your breath away: for instance, he’d brought
down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.430
It was hard to realize that a man in my own
generation was wealthy enough to do that.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:16.190
Why they came East I don’t know. They had
spent a year in France for no particular reason,

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:21.470
and then drifted here and there unrestfully
wherever people played polo and were rich

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:28.510
together. This was a permanent move, said
Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.890
it — I had no sight into Daisy’s heart,
but I felt that Tom would drift on forever

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:39.580
seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic
turbulence of some irrecoverable football

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.670
game.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.890
And so it happened that on a warm windy evening
I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:54.610
whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was
even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful

00:11:54.610 --> 00:12:01.160
red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking
the bay. The lawn started at the beach and

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:07.720
ran toward the front door for a quarter of
a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:14.170
and burning gardens — finally when it reached
the house drifting up the side in bright vines

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:20.940
as though from the momentum of its run. The
front was broken by a line of French windows,

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:27.270
glowing now with reflected gold and wide open
to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.560
in riding clothes was standing with his legs
apart on the front porch.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:38.850
He had changed since his New Haven years.
Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:45.710
with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious
manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:51.980
dominance over his face and gave him the appearance
of always leaning aggressively forward. Not

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.660
even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes
could hide the enormous power of that body

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.290
— he seemed to fill those glistening boots
until he strained the top lacing, and you

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:08.120
could see a great pack of muscle shifting
when his shoulder moved under his thin coat.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.750
It was a body capable of enormous leverage
— a cruel body.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:20.130
His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added
to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:24.880
There was a touch of paternal contempt in
it, even toward people he liked — and there

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.160
were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.530
“Now, don’t think my opinion on these
matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:39.150
because I’m stronger and more of a man than
you are.” We were in the same senior society,

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.220
and while we were never intimate I always
had the impression that he approved of me

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.740
and wanted me to like him with some harsh,
defiant wistfulness of his own.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.560
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:58.390
“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said,
his eyes flashing about restlessly.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:03.330
Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad
flat hand along the front vista, including

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:09.420
in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half
acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.380
motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:19.670
“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.”
He turned me around again, politely and abruptly.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.620
“We’ll go inside.”

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:27.480
We walked through a high hallway into a bright
rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.600
house by French windows at either end. The
windows were ajar and gleaming white against

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.410
the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow
a little way into the house. A breeze blew

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:44.970
through the room, blew curtains in at one
end and out the other like pale flags, twisting

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:50.140
them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of
the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:55.730
rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on
the sea.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:00.800
The only completely stationary object in the
room was an enormous couch on which two young

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:07.360
women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored
balloon. They were both in white, and their

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.410
dresses were rippling and fluttering as if
they had just been blown back in after a short

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:17.550
flight around the house. I must have stood
for a few moments listening to the whip and

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:23.530
snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture
on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:28.950
Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught
wind died out about the room, and the curtains

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:34.700
and the rugs and the two young women ballooned
slowly to the floor.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:40.160
The younger of the two was a stranger to me.
She was extended full length at her end of

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.700
the divan, completely motionless, and with
her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:51.660
something on it which was quite likely to
fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:58.700
eyes she gave no hint of it — indeed, I
was almost surprised into murmuring an apology

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.940
for having disturbed her by coming in.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:07.280
The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to
rise — she leaned slightly forward with

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:13.540
a conscientious expression — then she laughed,
an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.330
too and came forward into the room.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:23.040
“I’m p-paralyzed with happiness.” She
laughed again, as if she said something very

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.860
witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking
up into my face, promising that there was

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:35.130
no one in the world she so much wanted to
see. That was a way she had. She hinted in

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:40.800
a murmur that the surname of the balancing
girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.120
Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean
toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.150
it no less charming.)

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:53.570
At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered,
she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:58.670
then quickly tipped her head back again — the
object she was balancing had obviously tottered

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:05.660
a little and given her something of a fright.
Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.610
Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency
draws a stunned tribute from me.

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:18.120
I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask
me questions in her low, thrilling voice.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.439
It was the kind of voice that the ear follows
up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:30.300
of notes that will never be played again.
Her face was sad and lovely with bright things

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:36.520
in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate
mouth, but there was an excitement in her

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:43.610
voice that men who had cared for her found
difficult to forget: a singing compulsion,

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:49.160
a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she
had done gay, exciting things just a while

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:55.360
since and that there were gay, exciting things
hovering in the next hour.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.660
I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago
for a day on my way East, and how a dozen

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.920
people had sent their love through me.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.550
“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.680
“The whole town is desolate. All the cars
have the left rear wheel painted black as

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.990
a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent
wail all night along the north shore.”

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:23.230
“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. To-morrow!”
Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.490
to see the baby.”

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.090
“I’d like to.”

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:31.360
“She’s asleep. She’s three years old.
Haven’t you ever seen her?”

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.610
“Never.”

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.390
“Well, you ought to see her. She’s ——”

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:41.140
Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly
about the room, stopped and rested his hand

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.750
on my shoulder.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.050
“What you doing, Nick?”

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.210
“I’m a bond man.”

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.080
“Who with?”

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.170
I told him.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.030
“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.380
This annoyed me.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:19:00.110
“You will,” I answered shortly. “You
will if you stay in the East.”

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:05.820
“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you
worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:11.610
back at me, as if he were alert for something
more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.110
anywhere else.”

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:19.270
At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!”
with such suddenness that I started — it

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:24.890
was the first word she uttered since I came
into the room. Evidently it surprised her

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:30.810
as much as it did me, for she yawned and with
a series of rapid, deft movements stood up

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:31.930
into the room.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:37.520
“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve
been lying on that sofa for as long as I can

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.250
remember.”

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.550
“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted,
“I’ve been trying to get you to New York

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.540
all afternoon.”

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:50.940
“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four
cocktails just in from the pantry, “I’m

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.800
absolutely in training.”

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.530
Her host looked at her incredulously.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:02.920
“You are!” He took down his drink as if
it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “How

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.370
you ever get anything done is beyond me.”

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:12.430
I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it
was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:18.260
at her. She was a slender, small-breasted
girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:24.610
by throwing her body backward at the shoulders
like a young cadet. Her gray sun-strained

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:31.930
eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal
curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:39.350
face. It occurred to me now that I had seen
her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:45.370
“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously.
“I know somebody there.”

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.970
“I don’t know a single ——”

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.480
“You must know Gatsby.”

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.760
“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”

00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:00.210
Before I could reply that he was my neighbor
dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:05.570
imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled
me from the room as though he were moving

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.559
a checker to another square.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:14.920
Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly
on their hips, the two young women preceded

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.150
us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward
the sunset, where four candles flickered on

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.480
the table in the diminished wind.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:32.120
“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning.
She snapped them out with her fingers. “In

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:38.760
two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the
year.” She looked at us all radiantly. “Do

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:44.559
you always watch for the longest day of the
year and then miss it? I always watch for

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:46.809
the longest day in the year and then miss
it.”

00:21:46.809 --> 00:21:53.670
“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss
Baker, sitting down at the table as if she

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.260
were getting into bed.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:01.630
“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll
we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.710
do people plan?”

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:09.900
Before I could answer her eyes fastened with
an awed expression on her little finger.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.559
“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:17.440
We all looked — the knuckle was black and
blue.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:24.930
“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly.
“I know you didn’t mean to, but you did

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:32.870
do it. That’s what I get for marrying a
brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.830
specimen of a ——”

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:41.980
“I hate that word hulking,” objected Tom
crossly, “even in kidding.”

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.590
“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:51.340
Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once,
unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.990
that was never quite chatter, that was as
cool as their white dresses and their impersonal

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:05.590
eyes in the absence of all desire. They were
here, and they accepted Tom and me, making

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:12.030
only a polite pleasant effort to entertain
or to be entertained. They knew that presently

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:17.309
dinner would be over and a little later the
evening too would be over and casually put

00:23:17.309 --> 00:23:23.720
away. It was sharply different from the West,
where an evening was hurried from phase to

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:31.260
phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed
anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.480
of the moment itself.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.920
“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,”
I confessed on my second glass of corky but

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.390
rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk
about crops or something?”

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:51.160
I meant nothing in particular by this remark,
but it was taken up in an unexpected way.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:56.470
“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke
out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:02.120
a terrible pessimist about things. Have you
read ‘The Rise of the Colored Empires’

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.210
by this man Goddard?”

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:09.720
“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised
by his tone.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:16.750
“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody
ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:24.010
look out the white race will be — will be
utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff;

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.850
it’s been proved.”

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:31.190
“Tom’s getting very profound,” said
Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:37.670
sadness. “He reads deep books with long
words in them. What was that word we ——”

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:43.890
“Well, these books are all scientific,”
insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.470
“This fellow has worked out the whole thing.
It’s up to us, who are the dominant race,

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:52.559
to watch out or these other races will have
control of things.”

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:58.880
“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered
Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.770
sun.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:05.620
“You ought to live in California —” began
Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.429
heavily in his chair.

00:25:07.429 --> 00:25:14.400
“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am,
and you are, and you are, and ——” After

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:21.059
an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy
with a slight nod, and she winked at me again.

00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:27.640
“— And we’ve produced all the things
that go to make civilization — oh, science

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.820
and art, and all that. Do you see?”

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:38.960
There was something pathetic in his concentration,
as if his complacency, more acute than of

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:45.600
old, was not enough to him any more. When,
almost immediately, the telephone rang inside

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.580
and the butler left the porch Daisy seized
upon the momentary interruption and leaned

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.490
toward me.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:57.460
“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she
whispered enthusiastically. “It’s about

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.490
the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about
the butler’s nose?”

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.270
“That’s why I came over to-night.”

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:09.570
“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used
to be the silver polisher for some people

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:15.020
in New York that had a silver service for
two hundred people. He had to polish it from

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.740
morning till night, until finally it began
to affect his nose ——”

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:24.480
“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested
Miss Baker.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:31.970
“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until
finally he had to give up his position.”

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:38.220
For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic
affection upon her glowing face; her voice

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:44.929
compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened
— then the glow faded, each light deserting

00:26:44.929 --> 00:26:51.650
her with lingering regret, like children leaving
a pleasant street at dusk.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:56.500
The butler came back and murmured something
close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.420
pushed back his chair, and without a word
went inside. As if his absence quickened something

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:07.220
within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her
voice glowing and singing.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:14.780
“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You
remind me of a — of a rose, an absolute

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:21.380
rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss
Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:27.830
This was untrue. I am not even faintly like
a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:33.420
stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her
heart was trying to come out to you concealed

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:39.600
in one of those breathless, thrilling words.
Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.559
table and excused herself and went into the
house.

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:50.530
Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance
consciously devoid of meaning. I was about

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:57.230
to speak when she sat up alertly and said
“Sh!” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:02.510
murmur was audible in the room beyond, and
Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:10.559
to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge
of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly,

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:13.040
and then ceased altogether.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.770
“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor
——” I said.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.520
“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.390
“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:32.650
“You mean to say you don’t know?” said
Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.340
everybody knew.”

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.020
“I don’t.”

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:42.900
“Why ——” she said hesitantly, “Tom’s
got some woman in New York.”

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.100
“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.660
Miss Baker nodded.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:55.740
“She might have the decency not to telephone
him at dinner time. Don’t you think?”

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.620
Almost before I had grasped her meaning there
was the flutter of a dress and the crunch

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.049
of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back
at the table.

00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:08.950
“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy
with tense gaiety.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:14.380
She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss
Baker and then at me, and continued: “I

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:20.070
looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very
romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:26.840
lawn that I think must be a nightingale come
over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:33.179
singing away ——” Her voice sang: “It’s
romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:41.840
“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably
to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner,

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.760
I want to take you down to the stables.”

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:51.220
The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and
as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:58.160
the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,
vanished into air. Among the broken fragments

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:03.500
of the last five minutes at table I remember
the candles being lit again, pointlessly,

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:09.799
and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely
at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. I

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:14.470
couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking,
but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:20.540
to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism,
was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:26.820
shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a
certain temperament the situation might have

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:34.280
seemed intriguing — my own instinct was
to telephone immediately for the police.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:40.179
The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned
again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet

00:30:40.179 --> 00:30:46.090
of twilight between them, strolled back into
the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:53.590
tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly
interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy

00:30:53.590 --> 00:31:00.350
around a chain of connecting verandas to the
porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:04.669
side by side on a wicker settee.

00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:10.210
Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling
its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:17.490
out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent
emotions possessed her, so I asked what I

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:21.860
thought would be some sedative questions about
her little girl.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:29.620
“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,”
she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.110
You didn’t come to my wedding.”

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.669
“I wasn’t back from the war.”

00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:41.240
“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well,
I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.030
pretty cynical about everything.”

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:50.679
Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but
she didn’t say any more, and after a moment

00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:54.790
I returned rather feebly to the subject of
her daughter.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:32:00.590
“I suppose she talks, and — eats, and
everything.”

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:10.030
“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently.
“Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:14.200
when she was born. Would you like to hear?”

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.360
“Very much.”

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:21.809
“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel
about — things. Well, she was less than

00:32:21.809 --> 00:32:29.630
an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I
woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:35.660
feeling, and asked the nurse right away if
it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:43.330
a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept.
‘all right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:50.580
a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool — that’s
the best thing a girl can be in this world,

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.900
a beautiful little fool.”

00:32:51.900 --> 00:33:00.809
“You see I think everything’s terrible
anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way.

00:33:00.809 --> 00:33:08.070
“Everybody thinks so — the most advanced
people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:14.250
and seen everything and done everything.”
Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way,

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:19.020
rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with
thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated — God,

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.210
I’m sophisticated!”

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:29.960
The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to
compel my attention, my belief, I felt the

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:36.750
basic insincerity of what she had said. It
made me uneasy, as though the whole evening

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:45.179
had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory
emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough,

00:33:45.179 --> 00:33:51.429
in a moment she looked at me with an absolute
smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:58.929
her membership in a rather distinguished secret
society to which she and Tom belonged.

00:33:58.929 --> 00:34:04.299
Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.

00:34:04.299 --> 00:34:08.759
Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the
long couch and she read aloud to him from

00:34:08.759 --> 00:34:14.210
the Saturday Evening Post. — the words,
murmurous and uninflected, running together

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:20.899
in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright
on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow

00:34:20.899 --> 00:34:26.729
of her hair, glinted along the paper as she
turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles

00:34:26.729 --> 00:34:28.009
in her arms.

00:34:28.009 --> 00:34:32.999
When we came in she held us silent for a moment
with a lifted hand.

00:34:32.999 --> 00:34:38.879
“To be continued,” she said, tossing the
magazine on the table, “in our very next

00:34:38.879 --> 00:34:40.509
issue.”

00:34:40.509 --> 00:34:45.179
Her body asserted itself with a restless movement
of her knee, and she stood up.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:50.460
“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently
finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.720
this good girl to go to bed.”

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.279
“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament
to-morrow,” explained Daisy, “over at

00:34:57.279 --> 00:34:57.799
Westchester.”

00:34:57.799 --> 00:35:02.130
“Oh — you’re Jordan Baker.”

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:09.349
I knew now why her face was familiar — its
pleasing contemptuous expression had looked

00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:14.499
out at me from many rotogravure pictures of
the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs

00:35:14.499 --> 00:35:22.609
and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of
her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but

00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:25.130
what it was I had forgotten long ago.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:30.289
“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake
me at eight, won’t you.”

00:35:30.289 --> 00:35:31.650
“If you’ll get up.”

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:36.599
“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you
anon.”

00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:43.509
“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy.
“In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage.

00:35:43.509 --> 00:35:49.049
Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of
— oh — fling you together. You know — lock

00:35:49.049 --> 00:35:54.210
you up accidentally in linen closets and push
you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:54.470
of thing ——”

00:35:54.470 --> 00:36:01.229
“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the
stairs. “I haven’t heard a word.”

00:36:01.229 --> 00:36:07.829
“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after
a moment. “They oughtn’t to let her run

00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:10.079
around the country this way.”

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:14.549
“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.

00:36:14.549 --> 00:36:16.890
“Her family.”

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:23.390
“Her family is one aunt about a thousand
years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:27.970
after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going
to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:32.339
I think the home influence will be very good
for her.”

00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:36.220
Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment
in silence.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.869
“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.

00:36:39.869 --> 00:36:45.289
“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was
passed together there. Our beautiful white

00:36:45.289 --> 00:36:46.289
——”

00:36:45.289 --> 00:36:51.720
“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart
talk on the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.319
“Did I?” She looked at me.

00:36:54.319 --> 00:36:59.910
“I can’t seem to remember, but I think
we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.359
sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and
first thing you know ——”

00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:09.529
“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,”
he advised me.

00:37:09.529 --> 00:37:14.619
I said lightly that I had heard nothing at
all, and a few minutes later I got up to go

00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:21.380
home. They came to the door with me and stood
side by side in a cheerful square of light.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.160
As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called:
“Wait!”

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:30.799
“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s
important. We heard you were engaged to a

00:37:30.799 --> 00:37:32.630
girl out West.”

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:39.089
“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly.
“We heard that you were engaged.”

00:37:39.089 --> 00:37:42.170
“It’s libel. I’m too poor.”

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:48.589
“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising
me by opening up again in a flower-like way.

00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:53.910
“We heard it from three people, so it must
be true.”

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:59.729
Of course I knew what they were referring
to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The

00:37:59.729 --> 00:38:05.819
fact that gossip had published the banns was
one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t

00:38:05.819 --> 00:38:10.549
stop going with an old friend on account of
rumors, and on the other hand I had no intention

00:38:10.549 --> 00:38:13.900
of being rumored into marriage.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:20.849
Their interest rather touched me and made
them less remotely rich — nevertheless,

00:38:20.849 --> 00:38:27.180
I was confused and a little disgusted as I
drove away. It seemed to me that the thing

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:34.099
for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house,
child in arms — but apparently there were

00:38:34.099 --> 00:38:41.210
no such intentions in her head. As for Tom,
the fact that he “had some woman in New

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:47.680
York.” was really less surprising than that
he had been depressed by a book. Something

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:53.479
was making him nibble at the edge of stale
ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no

00:38:53.479 --> 00:38:58.829
longer nourished his peremptory heart.

00:38:58.829 --> 00:39:04.239
Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs
and in front of wayside garages, where new

00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:11.380
red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and
when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:17.249
the car under its shed and sat for a while
on an abandoned grass roller in the yard.

00:39:17.249 --> 00:39:23.440
The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright
night, with wings beating in the trees and

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:30.170
a persistent organ sound as the full bellows
of the earth blew the frogs full of life.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:35.339
The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across
the moonlight, and turning my head to watch

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:40.509
it, I saw that I was not alone — fifty feet
away a figure had emerged from the shadow

00:39:40.509 --> 00:39:44.799
of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing
with his hands in his pockets regarding the

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:51.549
silver pepper of the stars. Something in his
leisurely movements and the secure position

00:39:51.549 --> 00:39:57.930
of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it
was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:01.700
what share was his of our local heavens.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:07.979
I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned
him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction.

00:40:07.979 --> 00:40:13.339
But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a
sudden intimation that he was content to be

00:40:13.339 --> 00:40:19.729
alone — he stretched out his arms toward
the dark water in a curious way, and, far

00:40:19.729 --> 00:40:25.920
as I was from him, I could have sworn he was
trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:32.880
— and distinguished nothing except a single
green light, minute and far away, that might

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:39.410
have been the end of a dock. When I looked
once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:47.239
I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.
