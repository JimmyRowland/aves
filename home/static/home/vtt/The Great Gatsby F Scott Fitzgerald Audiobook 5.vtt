Chapter 5

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.740
When I came home to West Egg that night I
was afraid for a moment that my house was

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.790
on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner
of the peninsula was blazing with light, which

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:21.789
fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin
elongating glints upon the roadside wires.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.579
Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s
house, lit from tower to cellar.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.550
At first I thought it was another party, a
wild rout that had resolved itself into “hide-and-go-seek”

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.149
or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the
house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.399
a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew
the wires and made the lights go off and on

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:53.559
again as if the house had winked into the
darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.350
walking toward me across his lawn.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.879
“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,”
I said.

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.049
“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it
absently. “I have been glancing into some

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.720
of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island,
old sport. In my car.”

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.799
“It’s too late.”

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.670
“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-pool?
I haven’t made use of it all summer.”

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.140
“I’ve got to go to bed.”

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.930
“All right.”

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.520
He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.700
“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after
a moment. “I’m going to call up Daisy

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.460
to-morrow and invite her over here to tea.”

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.890
“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly.
“I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.710
“What day would suit you?”

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.299
“What day would suit you?” he corrected
me quickly. “I don’t want to put you to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.270
any trouble, you see.”

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.229
“How about the day after to-morrow?” He
considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance:

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.270
“I want to get the grass cut,” he said.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.730
We both looked at the grass — there was
a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.550
the darker, well-kept expanse of his began.
I suspected that he meant my grass.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.510
“There’s another little thing,” he said
uncertainly, and hesitated.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.610
“Would you rather put it off for a few days?”
I asked.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.990
“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least ——” He
fumbled with a series of beginnings. “Why,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.710
I thought — why, look here, old sport, you
don’t make much money, do you?”

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.140
“Not very much.”

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.490
This seemed to reassure him and he continued
more confidently.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.260
“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon
my — You see, I carry on a little business

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.620
on the side, a sort of side line, you understand.
And I thought that if you don’t make very

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.370
much — You’re selling bonds, aren’t
you, old sport?”

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.790
“Trying to.”

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.350
“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t
take up much of your time and you might pick

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.530
up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a
rather confidential sort of thing.”

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.150
I realize now that under different circumstances
that conversation might have been one of the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.110
crises of my life. But, because the offer
was obviously and tactlessly for a service

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.730
to be rendered, I had no choice except to
cut him off there.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.230
“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m
much obliged but I couldn’t take on any

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.870
more work.”

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.670
“You wouldn’t have to do any business
with Wolfsheim.” Evidently he thought that

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.140
I was shying away from the “gonnegtion”
mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.220
wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d
begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.070
to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.020
The evening had made me light-headed and happy;
I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.730
my front door. So I didn’t know whether
or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.709
how many hours he “glanced into rooms”
while his house blazed gaudily on. I called

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.949
up Daisy from the office next morning, and
invited her to come to tea.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.110
“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.020
“What?”

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.550
“Don’t bring Tom.”

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.319
“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.800
The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven
o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.879
lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said
that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.889
grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten
to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.759
West Egg Village to search for her among soggy,
whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.060
lemons and flowers.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.789
The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock
a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.400
innumerable receptacles to contain it. An
hour later the front door opened nervously,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.930
and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver
shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in. He

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.539
was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness
beneath his eyes.

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.800
“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.139
“The grass looks fine, if that’s what
you mean.”

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.379
“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh,
the grass in the yard.” He looked out the

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:45.969
window at it, but, judging from his expression,
I don’t believe he saw a thing.

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.469
“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely.
“One of the papers said they thought the

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:57.930
rain would stop about four. I think it was
the Journal. Have you got everything you need

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.159
in the shape of — of tea?”

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:07.319
I took him into the pantry, where he looked
a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.229
we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from
the delicatessen shop.

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.830
“Will they do?” I asked.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:22.639
“Of course, of course! They’re fine!”
and he added hollowly, “ . . . old sport.”

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.590
The rain cooled about half-past three to a
damp mist, through which occasional thin drops

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:35.300
swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes
through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.199
at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen
floor, and peering toward the bleared windows

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:46.159
from time to time as if a series of invisible
but alarming happenings were taking place

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:52.719
outside. Finally he got up and informed me,
in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:54.569
“Why’s that?”

00:06:54.569 --> 00:07:00.189
“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!”
He looked at his watch as if there was some

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:05.080
pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I
can’t wait all day.”

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.279
“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes
to four.”

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:15.569
He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed
him, and simultaneously there was the sound

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:21.809
of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped
up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:24.520
out into the yard.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:31.210
Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large
open car was coming up the drive. It stopped.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.960
Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a
three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.020
me with a bright ecstatic smile.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:47.029
“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest
one?”

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:52.770
The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a
wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:59.499
sound of it for a moment, up and down, with
my ear alone, before any words came through.

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:05.029
A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue
paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:09.270
with glistening drops as I took it to help
her from the car.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:18.089
“Are you in love with me,” she said low
in my ear, “or why did I have to come alone?”

00:08:18.089 --> 00:08:23.379
“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent.
Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:24.740
an hour.”

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:31.680
“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in
a grave murmur: “His name is Ferdie.”

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.060
“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:40.320
“I don’t think so,” she said innocently.
“Why?”

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.730
We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the
living-room was deserted.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:50.230
“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.030
“What’s funny?”

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:57.460
She turned her head as there was a light dignified
knocking at the front door. I went out and

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:05.130
opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his
hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets,

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:10.990
was standing in a puddle of water glaring
tragically into my eyes.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:16.510
With his hands still in his coat pockets he
stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:24.500
as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into
the living-room. It wasn’t a bit funny.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.900
Aware of the loud beating of my own heart
I pulled the door to against the increasing

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.300
rain.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:36.340
For half a minute there wasn’t a sound.
Then from the living-room I heard a sort of

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:43.060
choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed
by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.590
“I certainly am awfully glad to see you
again.”

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:56.000
A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing
to do in the hall, so I went into the room.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was
reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.330
counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.
His head leaned back so far that it rested

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.330
against the face of a defunct mantelpiece
clock, and from this position his distraught

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:18.530
eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting,
frightened but graceful, on the edge of a

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.420
stiff chair.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:27.780
“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby.
His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:33.520
lips parted with an abortive attempt at a
laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.090
to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his
head, whereupon he turned and caught it with

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:44.580
trembling fingers, and set it back in place.
Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.270
arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.810
“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:59.170
My own face had now assumed a deep tropical
burn. I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.700
out of the thousand in my head.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:08.130
“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:13.220
I think we all believed for a moment that
it had smashed in pieces on the floor.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:20.610
“We haven’t met for many years,” said
Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.440
ever be.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.940
“Five years next November.”

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:33.450
The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer
set us all back at least another minute. I

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.740
had them both on their feet with the desperate
suggestion that they help me make tea in the

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.240
kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it
in on a tray.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:50.180
Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes
a certain physical decency established itself.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:55.490
Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while
Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously

00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:02.750
from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy
eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:07.260
in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible
moment, and got to my feet.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.440
“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby
in immediate alarm.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.160
“I’ll be back.”

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.990
“I’ve got to speak to you about something
before you go.”

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.360
He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed
the door, and whispered:

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.640
“Oh, God!” in a miserable way.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.710
“What’s the matter?”

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:32.190
“This is a terrible mistake,” he said,
shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible,

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.550
terrible mistake.”

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:40.360
“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,”
and luckily I added: “Daisy’s embarrassed

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.490
too.”

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.390
“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.650
“Just as much as you are.”

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.540
“Don’t talk so loud.”

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.810
“You’re acting like a little boy,” I
broke out impatiently. “Not only that, but

00:12:54.810 --> 00:13:00.130
you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there
all alone.”

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:05.310
He raised his hand to stop my words, looked
at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.840
the door cautiously, went back into the other
room.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.070
I walked out the back way — just as Gatsby
had when he had made his nervous circuit of

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.910
the house half an hour before — and ran
for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:28.610
leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once
more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:35.960
well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded
in small, muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.680
There was nothing to look at from under the
tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:49.360
I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple,
for half an hour. A brewer had built it early

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.100
in the “period” craze, a decade before,
and there was a story that he’d agreed to

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.740
pay five years’ taxes on all the neighboring
cottages if the owners would have their roofs

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:05.470
thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal
took the heart out of his plan to Found a

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:11.230
Family — he went into an immediate decline.
His children sold his house with the black

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:17.590
wreath still on the door. Americans, while
occasionally willing to be serfs, have always

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:22.640
been obstinate about being peasantry.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.370
After half an hour, the sun shone again, and
the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:33.870
drive with the raw material for his servants’
dinner — I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:39.260
spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows
of his house, appeared momentarily in each,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:46.610
and, leaning from a large central bay, spat
meditatively into the garden. It was time

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:53.240
I went back. While the rain continued it had
seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:59.570
and swelling a little now and then with gusts
of emotion. But in the new silence I felt

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.990
that silence had fallen within the house too.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.660
I went in — after making every possible
noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:14.430
the stove — but I don’t believe they heard
a sound. They were sitting at either end of

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:19.890
the couch, looking at each other as if some
question had been asked, or was in the air,

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:26.300
and every vestige of embarrassment was gone.
Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:32.410
when I came in she jumped up and began wiping
at it with her handkerchief before a mirror.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:39.680
But there was a change in Gatsby that was
simply confounding. He literally glowed; without

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:47.310
a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being
radiated from him and filled the little room.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:54.660
“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if
he hadn’t seen me for years. I thought for

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.250
a moment he was going to shake hands.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.810
“It’s stopped raining.”

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:05.580
“Has it?” When he realized what I was
talking about, that there were twinkle-bells

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:11.590
of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a
weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:17.040
light, and repeated the news to Daisy. “What
do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:25.440
“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of
aching, grieving beauty, told only of her

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.630
unexpected joy.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:32.530
“I want you and Daisy to come over to my
house,” he said, “I’d like to show her

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.090
around.”

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.600
“You’re sure you want me to come?”

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.620
“Absolutely, old sport.”

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.570
Daisy went up-stairs to wash her face — too
late I thought with humiliation of my towels

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:50.210
— while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:55.320
“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he
demanded. “See how the whole front of it

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.340
catches the light.”

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.280
I agreed that it was splendid.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:07.100
“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched
door and square tower. “It took me just

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.329
three years to earn the money that bought
it.”

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:13.860
“I thought you inherited your money.”

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:19.579
“I did, old sport,” he said automatically,
“but I lost most of it in the big panic

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.919
— the panic of the war.”

00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:27.220
I think he hardly knew what he was saying,
for when I asked him what business he was

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.289
in he answered, “That’s my affair,”
before he realized that it wasn’t the appropriate

00:17:32.289 --> 00:17:33.249
reply.

00:17:33.249 --> 00:17:39.230
“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he
corrected himself. “I was in the drug business

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:45.190
and then I was in the oil business. But I’m
not in either one now.” He looked at me

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.860
with more attention. “Do you mean you’ve
been thinking over what I proposed the other

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.980
night?”

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.669
Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the
house and two rows of brass buttons on her

00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:59.679
dress gleamed in the sunlight.

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:03.960
“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.919
“Do you like it?”

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:10.240
“I love it, but I don’t see how you live
there all alone.”

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:19.629
“I keep it always full of interesting people,
night and day. People who do interesting things.

00:18:19.629 --> 00:18:22.690
Celebrated people.”

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.649
Instead of taking the short cut along the
Sound we went down the road and entered by

00:18:26.649 --> 00:18:32.350
the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy
admired this aspect or that of the feudal

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:38.409
silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens,
the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:45.909
odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the
pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It

00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:50.740
was strange to reach the marble steps and
find no stir of bright dresses in and out

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.580
the door, and hear no sound but bird voices
in the trees.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:01.899
And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette
music-rooms and Restoration salons, I felt

00:19:01.899 --> 00:19:07.480
that there were guests concealed behind every
couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:14.350
silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby
closed the door of “the Merton College Library.”

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:19.629
I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man
break into ghostly laughter.

00:19:19.629 --> 00:19:25.320
We went up-stairs, through period bedrooms
swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.789
with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and
poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths

00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:36.840
— intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled
man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.850
the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.”
I had seen him wandering hungrily about the

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:49.649
beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s
own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an

00:19:49.649 --> 00:19:55.190
Adam study, where we sat down and drank a
glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.179
in the wall.

00:19:57.179 --> 00:20:02.149
He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy,
and I think he revalued everything in his

00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:07.710
house according to the measure of response
it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes,

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:14.460
too, he stared around at his possessions in
a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:21.230
presence none of it was any longer real. Once
he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:27.629
His bedroom was the simplest room of all — except
where the dresser was garnished with a toilet

00:20:27.629 --> 00:20:34.899
set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush
with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon

00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:39.330
Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began
to laugh.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:46.590
“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,”
he said hilariously. “I can’t — When

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.450
I try to ——”

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:54.720
He had passed visibly through two states and
was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment

00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:01.230
and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with
wonder at her presence. He had been full of

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:06.820
the idea so long, dreamed it right through
to the end, waited with his teeth set, so

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:14.470
to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity.
Now, in the reaction, he was running down

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.070
like an overwound clock.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:23.119
Recovering himself in a minute he opened for
us two hulking patent cabinets which held

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:29.259
his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties,
and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks

00:21:29.259 --> 00:21:31.190
a dozen high.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:36.840
“I’ve got a man in England who buys me
clothes. He sends over a selection of things

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:41.259
at the beginning of each season, spring and
fall.”

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:47.869
He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing
them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer

00:21:47.869 --> 00:21:54.480
linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which
lost their folds as they fell and covered

00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:01.470
the table in many-colored disarray. While
we admired he brought more and the soft rich

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:08.200
heap mounted higher — shirts with stripes
and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:15.619
and lavender and faint orange, and monograms
of Indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained

00:22:15.619 --> 00:22:21.190
sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts
and began to cry stormily.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:27.950
“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she
sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:37.210
“It makes me sad because I’ve never seen
such — such beautiful shirts before.”

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.730
After the house, we were to see the grounds
and the swimming-pool, and the hydroplane

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.679
and the mid-summer flowers — but outside
Gatsby’s window it began to rain again,

00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:50.570
so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated
surface of the Sound.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:56.309
“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see
your home across the bay,” said Gatsby.

00:22:56.309 --> 00:23:02.490
“You always have a green light that burns
all night at the end of your dock.”

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:08.559
Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but
he seemed absorbed in what he had just said.

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:13.429
Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal
significance of that light had now vanished

00:23:13.429 --> 00:23:19.619
forever. Compared to the great distance that
had separated him from Daisy it had seemed

00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:27.009
very near to her, almost touching her. It
had seemed as close as a star to the moon.

00:23:27.009 --> 00:23:34.899
Now it was again a green light on a dock.
His count of enchanted objects had diminished

00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:37.619
by one.

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:43.960
I began to walk about the room, examining
various indefinite objects in the half darkness.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.039
A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting
costume attracted me, hung on the wall over

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.700
his desk.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.360
“Who’s this?”

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.320
“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.909
The name sounded faintly familiar.

00:23:59.909 --> 00:24:06.590
“He’s dead now. He used to be my best
friend years ago.”

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:11.090
There was a small picture of Gatsby, also
in yachting costume, on the bureau — Gatsby

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:16.110
with his head thrown back defiantly — taken
apparently when he was about eighteen.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:24.070
“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The
pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.470
— or a yacht.”

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:33.379
“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s
a lot of clippings — about you.”

00:24:33.379 --> 00:24:39.379
They stood side by side examining it. I was
going to ask to see the rubies when the phone

00:24:39.379 --> 00:24:42.450
rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:50.580
“Yes. . . . well, I can’t talk now. . . . I
can’t talk now, old sport. . . . I said

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:57.669
a small town. . . . he must know what a small
town is. . . . well, he’s no use to us if

00:24:57.669 --> 00:25:01.379
Detroit is his idea of a small town. . . . ”

00:25:01.379 --> 00:25:02.509
He rang off.

00:25:02.509 --> 00:25:07.100
“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the
window.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.889
The rain was still falling, but the darkness
had parted in the west, and there was a pink

00:25:11.889 --> 00:25:15.379
and golden billow of foamy clouds above the
sea.

00:25:15.379 --> 00:25:22.230
“Look at that,” she whispered, and then
after a moment: “I’d like to just get

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:27.090
one of those pink clouds and put you in it
and push you around.”

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:33.080
I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear
of it; perhaps my presence made them feel

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.950
more satisfactorily alone.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:42.820
“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby,
“we’ll have Klipspringer play the piano.”

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.730
He went out of the room calling “Ewing!”
and returned in a few minutes accompanied

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:53.529
by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man,
with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond

00:25:53.529 --> 00:25:59.669
hair. He was now decently clothed in a “sport
shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and

00:25:59.669 --> 00:26:02.960
duck trousers of a nebulous hue.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.600
“Did we interrupt your exercises?” inquired
Daisy politely.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:15.269
“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer,
in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d

00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:17.649
been asleep. Then I got up.. ..”

00:26:17.649 --> 00:26:21.860
“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby,
cutting him off. “Don’t you, Ewing, old

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.419
sport?”

00:26:22.419 --> 00:26:28.039
“I don’t play well. I don’t — I hardly
play at all. I’m all out of prac ——”

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:34.330
“We’ll go down-stairs,” interrupted
Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The gray windows

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:38.799
disappeared as the house glowed full of light.

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:44.919
In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary
lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette

00:26:44.919 --> 00:26:49.730
from a trembling match, and sat down with
her on a couch far across the room, where

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:55.289
there was no light save what the gleaming
floor bounced in from the hall.

00:26:55.289 --> 00:26:59.779
When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest,
he turned around on the bench and searched

00:26:59.779 --> 00:27:02.549
unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.

00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:08.480
“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told
you I couldn’t play. I’m all out of prac

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.480
——”

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.249
“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded
Gatsby. “Play!”

00:27:13.249 --> 00:27:14.889
“In the morning,

00:27:14.889 --> 00:27:16.049
In the evening,

00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:19.789
Ain’t we got fun——”

00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:24.769
Outside the wind was loud and there was a
faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All

00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:30.090
the lights were going on in West Egg now;
the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:36.749
home through the rain from New York. It was
the hour of a profound human change, and excitement

00:27:36.749 --> 00:27:38.809
was generating on the air.

00:27:38.809 --> 00:27:42.519
“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:47.730
The rich get richer and the poor get— children.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:48.230
In the meantime,

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.129
In between time——”

00:27:50.129 --> 00:27:54.879
As I went over to say good-by I saw that the
expression of bewilderment had come back into

00:27:54.879 --> 00:28:00.289
Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had
occurred to him as to the quality of his present

00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:07.889
happiness. Almost five years! There must have
been moments even that afternoon when Daisy

00:28:07.889 --> 00:28:13.119
tumbled short of his dreams — not through
her own fault, but because of the colossal

00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:20.769
vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond
her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself

00:28:20.769 --> 00:28:25.690
into it with a creative passion, adding to
it all the time, decking it out with every

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:32.359
bright feather that drifted his way. No amount
of fire or freshness can challenge what a

00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:36.519
man will store up in his ghostly heart.

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:42.609
As I watched him he adjusted himself a little,
visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as

00:28:42.609 --> 00:28:48.549
she said something low in his ear he turned
toward her with a rush of emotion. I think

00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:54.869
that voice held him most, with its fluctuating,
feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be

00:28:54.869 --> 00:28:59.100
over-dreamed — that voice was a deathless
song.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:05.629
They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up
and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know

00:29:05.629 --> 00:29:12.139
me now at all. I looked once more at them
and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed

00:29:12.139 --> 00:29:19.269
by intense life. Then I went out of the room
and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving

00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:20.369
them there together.
