00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.769
Chapter 4

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.460
On Sunday morning while church bells rang
in the villages alongshore, the world and

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.950
its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house
and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.260
“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young
ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.060
and his flowers. “One time he killed a man
who had found out that he was nephew to Von

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.119
Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.
Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.289
drop into that there crystal glass.”

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:41.659
Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a
time-table the names of those who came to

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:47.510
Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old
time-table now, disintegrating at its folds,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:55.589
and headed “This schedule in effect July
5th, 1922.” But I can still read the gray

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.149
names, and they will give you a better impression
than my generalities of those who accepted

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.100
Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle
tribute of knowing nothing whatever about

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.990
him.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.609
From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers
and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:22.039
I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet,
who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:28.140
the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and
a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.789
in a corner and flipped up their noses like
goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:42.359
and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach
and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver,

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:48.210
whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white
one winter afternoon for no good reason at

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.189
all.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:56.969
Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember.
He came only once, in white knickerbockers,

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.420
and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the
garden. From farther out on the Island came

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.840
the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders,
and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.319
and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells.
Snell was there three days before he went

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.090
to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel
drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.420
ran over his right hand. The Dancies came,
too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.120
sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads,
and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.209
girls.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:45.030
From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys
and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.870
the state senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled
Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.069
Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur
McCarty, all connected with the movies in

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.810
one way or another. And the Catlips and the
Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.040
Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.
Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.400
Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut.”) Ferret
and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly — they

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.709
came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into
the garden it meant he was cleaned out and

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.920
Associated Traction would have to fluctuate
profitably next day.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.959
A man named Klipspringer was there so often
and so long that he became known as “the

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.079
boarder.”— I doubt if he had any other
home. Of theatrical people there were Gus

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:48.370
Waize and Horace O’donavan and Lester Meyer
and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.849
from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons
and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.689
Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars
and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:06.430
Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now,
and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.230
by jumping in front of a subway train in Times
Square.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.019
Benny McClenahan arrived always with four
girls. They were never quite the same ones

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.380
in physical person, but they were so identical
one with another that it inevitably seemed

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.390
they had been there before. I have forgotten
their names — Jaqueline, I think, or else

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:37.140
Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their
last names were either the melodious names

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:43.410
of flowers and months or the sterner ones
of the great American capitalists whose cousins,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.950
if pressed, they would confess themselves
to be.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.570
In addition to all these I can remember that
Faustina O’Brien came there at least once

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.810
and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who
had his nose shot off in the war, and Mr.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:06.060
Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancee,
and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.070
once head of the American Legion, and Miss
Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.600
chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom
we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.120
knew it, I have forgotten.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.400
All these people came to Gatsby’s house
in the summer.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.960
At nine o’clock, one morning late in July,
Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.210
drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody
from its three-noted horn. It was the first

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.000
time he had called on me, though I had gone
to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.550
and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent
use of his beach.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.060
“Good morning, old sport. You’re having
lunch with me to-day and I thought we’d

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.340
ride up together.”

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.080
He was balancing himself on the dashboard
of his car with that resourcefulness of movement

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.730
that is so peculiarly American — that comes,
I suppose, with the absence of lifting work

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:10.590
or rigid sitting in youth and, even more,
with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.840
games. This quality was continually breaking
through his punctilious manner in the shape

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.390
of restlessness. He was never quite still;
there was always a tapping foot somewhere

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.610
or the impatient opening and closing of a
hand.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.260
He saw me looking with admiration at his car.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.080
“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?”
He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.600
you ever seen it before?”

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:45.500
I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was
a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.460
here and there in its monstrous length with
triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:59.400
tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth
of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.010
Sitting down behind many layers of glass in
a sort of green leather conservatory, we started

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.470
to town.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:13.090
I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen
times in the past month and found, to my disappointment,

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:19.650
that he had little to say: So my first impression,
that he was a person of some undefined consequence,

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.210
had gradually faded and he had become simply
the proprietor of an elaborate road-house

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.620
next door.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:34.040
And then came that disconcerting ride. We
hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.470
began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished
and slapping himself indecisively on the knee

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.880
of his caramel-colored suit.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:49.500
“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly.
“What’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.470
A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized
evasions which that question deserves.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.990
“Well, I’m going to tell you something
about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.470
want you to get a wrong idea of me from all
these stories you hear.”

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:10.840
So he was aware of the bizarre accusations
that flavored conversation in his halls.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:17.640
“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right
hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:25.110
stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy
people in the Middle West — all dead now.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:29.560
I was brought up in America but educated at
Oxford, because all my ancestors have been

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:35.079
educated there for many years. It is a family
tradition.”

00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:41.240
He looked at me sideways — and I knew why
Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.730
hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,”
or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:54.560
it had bothered him before. And with this
doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.240
and I wondered if there wasn’t something
a little sinister about him, after all.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.139
“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired
casually.

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:04.699
“San Francisco.”

00:09:04.699 --> 00:09:06.259
“I see.”

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:11.250
“My family all died and I came into a good
deal of money.”

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.990
His voice was solemn, as if the memory of
that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:23.009
him. For a moment I suspected that he was
pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:24.720
me otherwise.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.980
“After that I lived like a young rajah in
all the capitals of Europe — Paris, Venice,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.939
Rome — collecting jewels, chiefly rubies,
hunting big game, painting a little, things

00:09:37.939 --> 00:09:46.000
for myself only, and trying to forget something
very sad that had happened to me long ago.”

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.029
With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous
laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:58.420
that they evoked no image except that of a
turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.589
every pore as he pursued a tiger through the
Bois de Boulogne.

00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:08.860
“Then came the war, old sport. It was a
great relief, and I tried very hard to die,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:14.749
but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I
accepted a commission as first lieutenant

00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:22.170
when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took
two machine-gun detachments so far forward

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:28.240
that there was a half mile gap on either side
of us where the infantry couldn’t advance.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.060
We stayed there two days and two nights, a
hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:39.089
guns, and when the infantry came up at last
they found the insignia of three German divisions

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:45.829
among the piles of dead. I was promoted to
be a major, and every Allied government gave

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:53.870
me a decoration — even Montenegro, little
Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”

00:10:53.870 --> 00:11:00.550
Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words
and nodded at them — with his smile. The

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:06.319
smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled
history and sympathized with the brave struggles

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:12.970
of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated
fully the chain of national circumstances

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:20.939
which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s
warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged

00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:26.680
in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily
through a dozen magazines.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.230
He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal,
slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.339
“That’s the one from Montenegro.”

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:38.839
To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic
look.

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:45.689
“Orderi di Danilo,” ran the circular legend,
“Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”

00:11:45.689 --> 00:11:47.410
“Turn it.”

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:51.779
“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour
Extraordinary.”

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:59.220
“Here’s another thing I always carry.
A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.459
Trinity Quad — the man on my left is now
the Earl of Dorcaster.”

00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:08.860
It was a photograph of half a dozen young
men in blazers loafing in an archway through

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:15.379
which were visible a host of spires. There
was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger

00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:17.839
— with a cricket bat in his hand.

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:26.889
Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers
flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal;

00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:33.059
I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease,
with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings

00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:35.209
of his broken heart.

00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:40.809
“I’m going to make a big request of you
to-day,” he said, pocketing his souvenirs

00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:46.910
with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought
to know something about me. I didn’t want

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:54.079
you to think I was just some nobody. You see,
I usually find myself among strangers because

00:12:54.079 --> 00:13:01.350
I drift here and there trying to forget the
sad thing that happened to me.” He hesitated.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.680
“You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.920
“At lunch?”

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:12.329
“No, this afternoon. I happened to find
out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:15.670
“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss
Baker?”

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:21.860
“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker
has kindly consented to speak to you about

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.139
this matter.”

00:13:24.139 --> 00:13:29.689
I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this
matter” was, but I was more annoyed than

00:13:29.689 --> 00:13:36.439
interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea
in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was

00:13:36.439 --> 00:13:41.619
sure the request would be something utterly
fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d

00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:46.559
ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:53.249
He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness
grew on him as we neared the city. We passed

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:58.980
Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse
of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:07.089
along a cobbled slum lined with the dark,
undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.

00:14:07.089 --> 00:14:12.680
Then the valley of ashes opened out on both
sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.949
straining at the garage pump with panting
vitality as we went by.

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:24.040
With fenders spread like wings we scattered
light through half Long Island City — only

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.009
half, for as we twisted among the pillars
of the elevated I heard the familiar “jug

00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:33.709
— jug — spat!” of a motorcycle, and
a frantic policeman rode alongside.

00:14:33.709 --> 00:14:41.629
“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby.
We slowed down. Taking a white card from his

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:44.730
wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:50.149
“Right you are,” agreed the policeman,
tipping his cap. “Know you next time, Mr.

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:52.319
Gatsby. Excuse me!”

00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:54.600
“What was that?” I inquired.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.809
“The picture of Oxford?”

00:14:56.809 --> 00:15:02.470
“I was able to do the commissioner a favor
once, and he sends me a Christmas card every

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.939
year.”

00:15:04.939 --> 00:15:09.290
Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through
the girders making a constant flicker upon

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:15.089
the moving cars, with the city rising up across
the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:22.769
built with a wish out of non-olfactory money.
The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is

00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:29.119
always the city seen for the first time, in
its first wild promise of all the mystery

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:32.639
and the beauty in the world.

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:38.999
A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with
blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn

00:15:38.999 --> 00:15:44.480
blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for
friends. The friends looked out at us with

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.899
the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern
Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:57.420
splendid car was included in their sombre
holiday. As we crossed Blackwell’s Island

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:04.420
a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur,
in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:11.619
and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of
their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty

00:16:11.619 --> 00:16:13.189
rivalry.

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:19.949
“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid
over this bridge,” I thought; “anything

00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:22.379
at all. . . . ”

00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:30.069
Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular
wonder.

00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:37.529
Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second
Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:42.629
away the brightness of the street outside,
my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom,

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:44.300
talking to another man.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.559
“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfsheim.”

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:55.999
A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head
and regarded me with two fine growths of hair

00:16:55.999 --> 00:17:02.509
which luxuriated in either nostril. After
a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the

00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:03.790
half-darkness.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:09.680
“— So I took one look at him,” said
Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand earnestly,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.520
“and what do you think I did?”

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.270
“What?” I inquired politely.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:21.070
But evidently he was not addressing me, for
he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.060
his expressive nose.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:29.780
“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said:
‘all right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:36.240
penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut
it then and there.”

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.490
Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved
forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:46.320
Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was
starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.060
abstraction.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.950
“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:56.690
“This is a nice restaurant here,” said
Mr. Wolfsheim, looking at the Presbyterian

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:02.480
nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across
the street better!”

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:09.930
“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then
to Mr. Wolfsheim: “It’s too hot over there.”

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:16.210
“Hot and small — yes,” said Mr. Wolfsheim,
“but full of memories.”

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.230
“What place is that?” I asked.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.510
“The old Metropole.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:32.290
“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfsheim
gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:40.580
Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t
forget so long as I live the night they shot

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:47.950
Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at
the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:53.830
all evening. When it was almost morning the
waiter came up to him with a funny look and

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:59.880
says somebody wants to speak to him outside.
‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.520
get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:09.400
“‘Let the bastards come in here if they
want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.330
move outside this room.’

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:17.300
“It was four o’clock in the morning then,
and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.870
of seen daylight.”

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.160
“Did he go?” I asked innocently.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:29.640
“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfsheim’s nose
flashed at me indignantly. “He turned around

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:36.110
in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that
waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:43.770
out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three
times in his full belly and drove away.”

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.640
“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said,
remembering.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:57.060
“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned
to me in an interested way. “I understand

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.650
you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:07.100
The juxtaposition of these two remarks was
startling. Gatsby answered for me:

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.920
“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t
the man.”

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.520
“No?” Mr. Wolfsheim seemed disappointed.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:20.020
“This is just a friend. I told you we’d
talk about that some other time.”

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:25.060
“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfsheim,
“I had a wrong man.”

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:33.150
A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfsheim,
forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:40.080
of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious
delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:46.390
slowly all around the room — he completed
the arc by turning to inspect the people directly

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:52.700
behind. I think that, except for my presence,
he would have taken one short glance beneath

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.150
our own table.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:21:01.510
“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning
toward me, “I’m afraid I made you a little

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.170
angry this morning in the car.”

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.740
There was the smile again, but this time I
held out against it.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:15.380
“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered.
“And I don’t understand why you won’t

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.810
come out frankly and tell me what you want.
Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:27.240
“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured
me. “Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.570
you know, and she’d never do anything that
wasn’t all right.”

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.540
Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up,
and hurried from the room, leaving me with

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.300
Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:47.050
“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfsheim,
following him with his eyes. “Fine fellow,

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:52.650
isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect
gentleman.”

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.750
“Yes.”

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:58.180
“He’s an Oggsford man.”

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.290
“Oh!”

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:05.780
“He went to Oggsford College in England.
You know Oggsford College?”

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.220
“I’ve heard of it.”

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.780
“It’s one of the most famous colleges
in the world.”

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:18.930
“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?”
I inquired.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:25.490
“Several years,” he answered in a gratified
way. “I made the pleasure of his acquaintance

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:32.160
just after the war. But I knew I had discovered
a man of fine breeding after I talked with

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.350
him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s
the kind of man you’d like to take home

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:44.570
and introduce to your mother and sister.’.”
He paused. “I see you’re looking at my

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:50.980
cuff buttons.” I hadn’t been looking at
them, but I did now.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.670
They were composed of oddly familiar pieces
of ivory.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:23:01.990
“Finest specimens of human molars,” he
informed me.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:07.950
“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s
a very interesting idea.”

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:16.270
“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under
his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:22.090
about women. He would never so much as look
at a friend’s wife.”

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:27.700
When the subject of this instinctive trust
returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfsheim

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.080
drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his
feet.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.780
“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and
I’m going to run off from you two young

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.650
men before I outstay my welcome.”

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:45.330
“Don’t hurry, Meyer,” said Gatsby, without
enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfsheim raised his hand

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.980
in a sort of benediction.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:57.030
“You’re very polite, but I belong to another
generation,” he announced solemnly. “You

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:05.820
sit here and discuss your sports and your
young ladies and your ——” He supplied

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:13.790
an imaginary noun with another wave of his
hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old,

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:19.000
and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.230
As he shook hands and turned away his tragic
nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.580
anything to offend him.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:35.590
“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,”
explained Gatsby. “This is one of his sentimental

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:40.660
days. He’s quite a character around New
York — a denizen of Broadway.”

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:46.020
“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.900
“No.”

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.650
“A dentist?”

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:57.450
“Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he’s a gambler.”
Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: “He’s

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.910
the man who fixed the World’s Series back
in 1919.”

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:06.480
“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.640
The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course,
that the World’s Series had been fixed in

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:18.170
1919, but if I had thought of it at all I
would have thought of it as a thing that merely

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:25.060
happened, the end of some inevitable chain.
It never occurred to me that one man could

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:31.980
start to play with the faith of fifty million
people — with the single-mindedness of a

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.600
burglar blowing a safe.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.740
“How did he happen to do that?” I asked
after a minute.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.110
“He just saw the opportunity.”

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.070
“Why isn’t he in jail?”

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:50.510
“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s
a smart man.”

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:58.400
I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter
brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.130
across the crowded room.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:05.160
“Come along with me for a minute,” I said;
“I’ve got to say hello to some one.”

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.310
When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half
a dozen steps in our direction.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:14.230
“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly.
“Daisy’s furious because you haven’t

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.360
called up.”

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.880
“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:25.120
They shook hands briefly, and a strained,
unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.410
Gatsby’s face.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:31.630
“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded
Tom of me. “How’d you happen to come up

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.400
this far to eat?”

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.510
“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:46.350
I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no
longer there.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.980
One October day in nineteen-seventeen ——

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:54.030
(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting
up very straight on a straight chair in the

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.570
tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.560
— I was walking along from one place to
another, half on the sidewalks and half on

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:06.950
the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because
I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:13.260
on the soles that bit into the soft ground.
I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:17.310
a little in the wind, and whenever this happened
the red, white, and blue banners in front

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:23.480
of all the houses stretched out stiff and
said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:28.970
The largest of the banners and the largest
of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:33.430
She was just eighteen, two years older than
me, and by far the most popular of all the

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:39.430
young girls in Louisville. She dressed in
white, and had a little white roadster, and

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:44.560
all day long the telephone rang in her house
and excited young officers from Camp Taylor

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:51.370
demanded the privilege of monopolizing her
that night. “Anyways, for an hour!”

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:56.090
When I came opposite her house that morning
her white roadster was beside the curb, and

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:01.210
she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I
had never seen before. They were so engrossed

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:04.920
in each other that she didn’t see me until
I was five feet away.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.990
“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly.
“Please come here.”

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:15.350
I was flattered that she wanted to speak to
me, because of all the older girls I admired

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:23.150
her most. She asked me if I was going to the
Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well,

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:28.700
then, would I tell them that she couldn’t
come that day? The officer looked at Daisy

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:34.230
while she was speaking, in a way that every
young girl wants to be looked at sometime,

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:41.490
and because it seemed romantic to me I have
remembered the incident ever since. His name

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:49.230
was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on
him again for over four years — even after

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:53.560
I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize
it was the same man.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:29:00.760
That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year
I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:06.820
in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very
often. She went with a slightly older crowd

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:12.370
— when she went with anyone at all. Wild
rumors were circulating about her — how

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:16.990
her mother had found her packing her bag one
winter night to go to New York and say good-by

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:23.990
to a soldier who was going overseas. She was
effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:29.770
speaking terms with her family for several
weeks. After that she didn’t play around

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:34.480
with the soldiers any more, but only with
a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.490
in town, who couldn’t get into the army
at all.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:46.350
By the next autumn she was gay again, gay
as ever. She had a debut after the Armistice,

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:52.460
and in February she was presumably engaged
to a man from New Orleans. In June she married

00:29:52.460 --> 00:30:00.930
Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and
circumstance than Louisville ever knew before.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:06.810
He came down with a hundred people in four
private cars, and hired a whole floor of the

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:12.880
Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding
he gave her a string of pearls valued at three

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.890
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:23.700
I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half
an hour before the bridal dinner, and found

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:29.900
her lying on her bed as lovely as the June
night in her flowered dress — and as drunk

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:37.370
as a monkey. She had a bottle of Sauterne
in one hand and a letter in the other.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:45.380
“’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never
had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.320
it.”

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.540
“What’s the matter, Daisy?”

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:53.510
I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never
seen a girl like that before.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:31:00.680
“Here, deares’.” She groped around in
a waste-basket she had with her on the bed

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:07.280
and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take
’em down-stairs and give ’em back to whoever

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:15.840
they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s change’
her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.460
mine!’.”

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:25.110
She began to cry — she cried and cried.
I rushed out and found her mother’s maid,

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:31.200
and we locked the door and got her into a
cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:36.270
She took it into the tub with her and squeezed
it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:40.770
it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was
coming to pieces like snow.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:48.000
But she didn’t say another word. We gave
her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.610
forehead and hooked her back into her dress,
and half an hour later, when we walked out

00:31:53.610 --> 00:32:01.090
of the room, the pearls were around her neck
and the incident was over. Next day at five

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:05.250
o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without
so much as a shiver, and started off on a

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:09.980
three months’ trip to the South Seas.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.280
I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came
back, and I thought I’d never seen a girl

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.330
so mad about her husband. If he left the room
for a minute she’d look around uneasily,

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:22.790
and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and wear
the most abstracted expression until she saw

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:29.240
him coming in the door. She used to sit on
the sand with his head in her lap by the hour,

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:36.960
rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking
at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:45.930
to see them together — it made you laugh
in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:52.700
A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran
into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:58.730
and ripped a front wheel off his car. The
girl who was with him got into the papers,

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:05.050
too, because her arm was broken — she was
one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.760
Hotel.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:13.320
The next April Daisy had her little girl,
and they went to France for a year. I saw

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:18.520
them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville,
and then they came back to Chicago to settle

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:25.310
down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you
know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:33.010
them young and rich and wild, but she came
out with an absolutely perfect reputation.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:38.040
Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s
a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:45.270
people. You can hold your tongue, and, moreover,
you can time any little irregularity of your

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:53.330
own so that everybody else is so blind that
they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never

00:33:53.330 --> 00:34:00.670
went in for amour at all — and yet there’s
something in that voice of hers. . . .

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:08.089
Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name
Gatsby for the first time in years. It was

00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:13.379
when I asked you — do you remember? — if
you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had

00:34:13.379 --> 00:34:18.950
gone home she came into my room and woke me
up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:25.990
I described him — I was half asleep — she
said in the strangest voice that it must be

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:31.940
the man she used to know. It wasn’t until
then that I connected this Gatsby with the

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:37.329
officer in her white car.

00:34:37.329 --> 00:34:42.029
When Jordan Baker had finished telling all
this we had left the Plaza for half an hour

00:34:42.029 --> 00:34:47.669
and were driving in a victoria through Central
Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall

00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:53.450
apartments of the movie stars in the West
Fifties, and the clear voices of girls, already

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:57.869
gathered like crickets on the grass, rose
through the hot twilight:

00:34:57.869 --> 00:35:02.490
“I’m the Sheik of Araby.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.549
Your love belongs to me.

00:35:04.549 --> 00:35:08.589
At night when you’re are asleep

00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:12.299
Into your tent I’ll creep ——”

00:35:12.299 --> 00:35:15.569
“It was a strange coincidence,” I said.

00:35:15.569 --> 00:35:18.910
“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.549
“Why not?”

00:35:20.549 --> 00:35:26.920
“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy
would be just across the bay.”

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:32.519
Then it had not been merely the stars to which
he had aspired on that June night. He came

00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:38.279
alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb
of his purposeless splendor.

00:35:38.279 --> 00:35:45.430
“He wants to know,” continued Jordan,
“if you’ll invite Daisy to your house

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:50.539
some afternoon and then let him come over.”

00:35:50.539 --> 00:35:56.690
The modesty of the demand shook me. He had
waited five years and bought a mansion where

00:35:56.690 --> 00:36:03.119
he dispensed starlight to casual moths — so
that he could “come over” some afternoon

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:05.799
to a stranger’s garden.

00:36:05.799 --> 00:36:10.859
“Did I have to know all this before he could
ask such a little thing?”

00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:19.809
“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He
thought you might be offended. You see, he’s

00:36:19.809 --> 00:36:24.509
a regular tough underneath it all.”

00:36:24.509 --> 00:36:25.910
Something worried me.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:29.349
“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”

00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:37.359
“He wants her to see his house,” she explained.
“And your house is right next door.”

00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:38.700
“Oh!”

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.859
“I think he half expected her to wander
into one of his parties, some night,” went

00:36:43.859 --> 00:36:50.529
on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began
asking people casually if they knew her, and

00:36:50.529 --> 00:36:56.109
I was the first one he found. It was that
night he sent for me at his dance, and you

00:36:56.109 --> 00:37:02.529
should have heard the elaborate way he worked
up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested

00:37:02.529 --> 00:37:06.549
a luncheon in New York — and I thought he’d
go mad:

00:37:06.549 --> 00:37:09.960
“‘I don’t want to do anything out of
the way!’ he kept saying. ‘I want to see

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.740
her right next door.’

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:17.029
“When I said you were a particular friend
of Tom’s, he started to abandon the whole

00:37:17.029 --> 00:37:22.589
idea. He doesn’t know very much about Tom,
though he says he’s read a Chicago paper

00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:29.339
for years just on the chance of catching a
glimpse of Daisy’s name.”

00:37:29.339 --> 00:37:35.039
It was dark now, and as we dipped under a
little bridge I put my arm around Jordan’s

00:37:35.039 --> 00:37:42.569
golden shoulder and drew her toward me and
asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking

00:37:42.569 --> 00:37:48.829
of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this
clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:56.700
universal scepticism, and who leaned back
jauntily just within the circle of my arm.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:02.749
A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort
of heady excitement: “There are only the

00:38:02.749 --> 00:38:09.440
pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:15.130
“And Daisy ought to have something in her
life,” murmured Jordan to me.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.170
“Does she want to see Gatsby?”

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:23.339
“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t
want her to know. You’re just supposed to

00:38:23.339 --> 00:38:26.650
invite her to tea.”

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:32.059
We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then
the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:39.150
of delicate pale light, beamed down into the
park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:45.759
no girl whose disembodied face floated along
the dark cornices and blinding signs, and

00:38:45.759 --> 00:38:54.140
so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening
my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and

00:38:54.140 --> 00:39:00.180
so I drew her up again closer, this time to
my face.
