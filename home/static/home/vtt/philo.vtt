00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.930
Crash Course Philosophy is brought to you
by Squarespace.

2
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.710
And when we do this, we are being pragmatists.

3
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.600
Pragmatism is based on the theory that finding
true beliefs is

4
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.259
less important than finding beliefs that work,
practically, in the living of your life.

5
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.119
In this view, it doesn’t really matter whether
spinach actually helps muscle growth;

6
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.120
if eating spinach will improve your life, and believing that it’ll make you strong convinces you to eat it

7
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.739
– then it’s a useful belief, which is
all that matters.

8
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.560
Pragmatism is relatively recent as philosophical
movements go.

9
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.710
But some of the most well-known American pragmatists

10
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.540
– like William James, and, I would argue,
Indiana Jones –

11
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.920
have an ideological ancestor in 17th century
mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal.

12
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.129
You can be a pragmatist about basically anything –

13
00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.500
knowledge, spinach, metaphysics, ethics,
or whether it’s actually 11:30 right now or 11:40.

14
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.860
But Pascal took a pragmatic approach to one of the biggest issues in philosophy: God’s existence.

15
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:20.300
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.460
Pascal was a theist, which, given his place
in history may not be all that surprising.

17
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.660
This reasoning became known as Pascal’s Wager, and it’s really a gambler’s argument for religious belief.

18
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.500
Pascal’s thinking went like this:

19
00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.579
Either God exists or he doesn’t, and reason
will never give us an answer.

20
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.900
So you must choose blindly to believe or not to
believe in God – you can’t abstain from choosing

21
00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.420
If you choose to believe in God and he exists,
you get an infinite reward – heaven.

22
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.200
If you choose to believe in God and he doesn’t
exist, you’re not really out much.

23
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.229
If you choose not to believe in God and he
doesn’t exist, you also don’t gain much.

24
00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.560
If you choose not to believe in God and he
does exist, you get infinite punishment – hell.

25
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.549
Therefore, the smart bet is to put your
chips on God existing, every time.

26
00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.460
Pascal argued that, if there is the slightest chance that God exists – even if that chance is low –

27
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.919
only a fool would bet against his existence,
given that the stakes are so high.

28
00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.279
In the face of incomplete information, Pascal
decided,

29
00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.679
we should play the odds, and believe whatever
offers us the greatest benefit.

30
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.840
It’s kind of brilliant, right?

31
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.800
But there are a couple of ways you could argue
against this.

32
00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.879
Like, you might miss out on stuff that you
would otherwise want to do –

33
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.939
like, sleeping in on Sunday mornings, or living a heavy-metal-rock-star lifestyle, or, I dunno, coveting stuff.

34
00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.540
By this logic, you’d lose out if you abstained
from all of that in the name of something

35
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.120
He thought theists have better lives, not because God is blessing them as some kind of reward,

36
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.659
but because belief simply has inherent benefits –

37
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.780
like the security of feeling that the world
is ordered and meaningful…

38
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.800
That someone is always looking out for you…

39
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.140
That death isn’t the end.

40
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.940
Now, even if you agree that religious belief is comforting, you might still question Pascal’s motives.

41
00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:23.698
Well, not according to Pascal.

42
00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.539
He thought how and why you choose to believe
doesn’t really matter, because the fact is,

43
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.359
God doesn’t care how he gets you, as long
as he gets you.

44
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.760
OK, so how do you will yourself into believing in something, just because it’s where the smart money is?

45
00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.540
And you do this, basically, by walking the
walk and talking the talk.

46
00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.430
Start going to church. Start praying.
Hang out with other believers.

47
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.720
At first it might seem weird and disingenuous, but over time, it’ll become an ingrained part of your belief system.

48
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.460
You know what it’s kind of like?
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

49
00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.519
Indy is painted as a pretty agnostic character.

50
00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.439
He hunts religious relics for a living,

51
00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.189
but the powers that those relics are said
to possess are just “hocus pocus” to him.

52
00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.250
So, at the end of The Last Crusade,
(spoilers) Indy manages to find the Holy Grail,

53
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.889
in an ancient temple, after getting through
a bunch of booby traps.

54
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.169
and he has to jump into an abyss with the
hope that he will somehow survive.

55
00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.229
Indy ends up passing all of these tests.

56
00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.580
But not because he suddenly stops being agnostic and starts believing in God – at least not that we know of.

57
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.780
Instead, he just does what he has to do.
He’s literally going through the motions.

58
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.219
There’s something about that, that would
make Pascal proud.

59
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.760
Because, to him, it would probably look like Indy was on the path to eventually, truly believing.

60
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.719
Now, some critics have pointed out that, when
it comes to a really usable belief system,

61
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.139
you’re gonna need morethan just: fake it
‘til you make it.

62
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.560
For example, maybe you were one of those kids, raised in a religious household, who was just never feeling it.

63
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.960
We all know people who were immersed in a
culture of religious belief from birth,

64
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.989
but end up to rejecting those beliefs as adults.

65
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.909
And for those people, trying to force yourself
to believe is not only ineffective,

66
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.479
it can lead to some pretty serious unhappiness
– the exact opposite of what a pragmatist wants.

67
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.900
So it might be that, for a pragmatist, the best advice for non-believers is that they just gotta live their lives.

68
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.560
But Soren Kierkegaard, the 19th century Danish
philosopher, went even further.

69
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.140
He adopted the famous tenant of fideism, stating:
“I believe because it is absurd to believe.”

70
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.599
Fideism is the school of thought that says
religious belief has to come from faith alone.

71
00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.820
It says that stuff like arguments and evidence
actually kill what’s great about religion

72
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.710
– which is wonder and mystery.

73
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.969
Kierkegaard said that the fantastic thing
about belief in God is that it’s entirely irrational

74
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.919
– you can’t do it with your brain.

75
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.479
You have to take what he called the leap to
faith.

76
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.719
And, again, here I turn to Indiana Jones.

77
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.509
There is no way he can do it – it’s suicide.

78
00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.599
But, it turns out, there’s a bridge.

79
00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.479
He can’t see it, but in order to find out
that it’s there, he has to take that step.

80
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.700
He has to take a chance on something that
defies all reason.

81
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.400
That’s what religion is all about, according
to Kierkegaard.

82
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.460
We jump and hope like hell that God catches
us.

83
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.549
And the only way to know, is to jump.

84
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.449
We have to surrender reason to get to truth.

85
00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.569
Now, I hate to break it to you, but this is
the end of our unit on the philosophy of religion.

86
00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.270
I’m interested to hear what you think about
that in the comments.

87
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.450
But before we go, I want to head to the Thought
Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

88
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.870
Our old friend Bertrand Russell once posited
the existence of a china teapot,

89
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.379
orbiting the sun somewhere between Earth and
Mars.

90
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.100
Let’s say that back on Earth there were a
bunch of Teapot-ists, people who argued that,

91
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.669
since we can’t disprove the teapot’s existence,
they were justified in believing in it.

92
00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:01.159
Not only that, they constructed great buildings, erected statues, composed songs, held weekly services,

93
00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:03.729
and appealed to the teapot for help in their
daily lives.

94
00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.998
But everyone else thought the Teapot-ists
were ridiculous, because there was no evidence

95
00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:09.830
to support their belief in the teapot.

96
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.550
For their part, the Teapot-ists just replied that none of the Ateapot-ists could prove that it wasn’t there.

97
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.700
Thanks, Thought Bubble! Aaand I’m sure you
can see where I’m going with this.

98
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.360
Pragmatism, or the leap to faith, might be
a solution to the problem of God’s existence,

99
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.420
if you’re not satisfied with any of the
other, more evidence-based arguments.

100
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.580
But believing something because it’s expedient

101
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.680
– or because it frees you from having to have
any reasons at all – can still have its risks.

102
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.660
After all, if we can leap to God, we can also leap to Russell’s teapot, or to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

103
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.840
Or, much worse, we could leap to particular
beliefs about God

104
00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:42.860
– like that he wants us to deny rights to
certain kinds of people – or kill them.

105
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.659
These beliefs aren’t representative of the
views of most theists, but the problem is,

106
00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:50.900
if you’re giving up on reasons and evidence,
all beliefs are philosophically equal.

107
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:56.280
We count on evidence and justification to help us adjudicate between beliefs, to decide what we value.

108
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.200
If you throw that out, and fall back on faith alone, the sum of your religious arguments is going to end up being:

109
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.840
I have faith in the things I choose to have
faith in.

110
00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:07.159
And in that case, no one can tell anyone else
that their belief is wrong,

111
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.379
and we’ve also learned about fideism and
Kierkegaard’s leap to faith.

112
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.480
Next time we’re going to learn about existentialism, which is a movement Kierkegaard is considered to belong to.

113
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.800
But as we will see, existentialists can come
in many different flavors.
