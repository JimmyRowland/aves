Chapter 2

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.750
About half way between West Egg and New York
the motor road hastily joins the railroad

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.950
and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile,
so as to shrink away from a certain desolate

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.420
area of land. This is a valley of ashes — a
fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.670
into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens;
where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.210
and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent
effort, of men who move dimly and already

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.579
crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally
a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.870
track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes
to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.709
swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an
impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:59.359
operations from your sight. But above the
gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:07.280
drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after
a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.790
The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue
and gigantic — their irises are one yard

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.960
high. They look out of no face, but, instead,
from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.880
which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently
some wild wag of an oculist set them there

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.610
to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens,
and then sank down himself into eternal blindness,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.020
or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes,
dimmed a little by many paintless days, under

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.990
sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping
ground.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.710
The valley of ashes is bounded on one side
by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.730
is up to let barges through, the passengers
on waiting trains can stare at the dismal

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.420
scene for as long as half an hour. There is
always a halt there of at least a minute,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.479
and it was because of this that I first met
Tom Buchanan’s mistress.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.980
The fact that he had one was insisted upon
wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.799
the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants
with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:24.030
about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though
I was curious to see her, I had no desire

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.310
to meet her — but I did. I went up to New
York with Tom on the train one afternoon,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.989
and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped
to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow,

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.799
literally forced me from the car.

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.819
“We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I
want you to meet my girl.”

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.230
I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon,
and his determination to have my company bordered

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.930
on violence. The supercilious assumption was
that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.279
to do.

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:59.629
I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad
fence, and we walked back a hundred yards

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.049
along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s
persistent stare. The only building in sight

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.040
was a small block of yellow brick sitting
on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.549
Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous
to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.419
it contained was for rent and another was
an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:30.450
of ashes; the third was a garage — Repairs.
George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold. — and

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.219
I followed Tom inside.

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:38.659
The interior was unprosperous and bare; the
only car visible was the dust-covered wreck

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:44.579
of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner.
It had occurred to me that this shadow of

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.930
a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous
and romantic apartments were concealed overhead,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.120
when the proprietor himself appeared in the
door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.400
of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man,
anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.569
us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light
blue eyes.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.519
“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping
him jovially on the shoulder. “How’s business?”

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.310
“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson
unconvincingly. “When are you going to sell

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.730
me that car?”

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.710
“Next week; I’ve got my man working on
it now.”

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.610
“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.320
“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And
if you feel that way about it, maybe I’d

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.370
better sell it somewhere else after all.”

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.440
“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson
quickly. “I just meant ——”

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.690
His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently
around the garage. Then I heard footsteps

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.380
on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish
figure of a woman blocked out the light from

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.870
the office door. She was in the middle thirties,
and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:08.570
flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face,
above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine,

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.540
contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but
there was an immediately perceptible vitality

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.460
about her as if the nerves of her body were
continually smouldering. She smiled slowly

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.310
and, walking through her husband as if he
were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.640
him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips,
and without turning around spoke to her husband

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.680
in a soft, coarse voice:

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.890
“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody
can sit down.”

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.680
“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and
went toward the little office, mingling immediately

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.110
with the cement color of the walls. A white
ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.750
hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity
— except his wife, who moved close to Tom.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.810
“I want to see you,” said Tom intently.
“Get on the next train.”

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.410
“All right.”

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.370
“I’ll meet you by the news-stand on the
lower level.” She nodded and moved away

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.810
from him just as George Wilson emerged with
two chairs from his office door.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.120
We waited for her down the road and out of
sight. It was a few days before the Fourth

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.840
of July, and a gray, scrawny Italian child
was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.660
track.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:36.340
“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom,
exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.450
“Awful.”

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.520
“It does her good to get away.”

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.820
“Doesn’t her husband object?”

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:50.710
“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister
in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.750
he’s alive.”

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:58.870
So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up
together to New York — or not quite together,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:05.560
for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another
car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.810
of those East Eggers who might be on the train.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.720
She had changed her dress to a brown figured
muslin, which stretched tight over her rather

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.430
wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform
in New York. At the news-stand she bought

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.150
a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture
magazine, and in the station drug-store some

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:33.700
cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Up-stairs,
in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:39.490
drive away before she selected a new one,
lavender-colored with gray upholstery, and

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:45.360
in this we slid out from the mass of the station
into the glowing sunshine. But immediately

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.000
she turned sharply from the window and, leaning
forward, tapped on the front glass.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.770
“I want to get one of those dogs,” she
said earnestly. “I want to get one for the

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.380
apartment. They’re nice to have — a dog.”

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:04.320
We backed up to a gray old man who bore an
absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.760
In a basket swung from his neck cowered a
dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.680
breed.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.780
“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson
eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.830
“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:26.210
“I’d like to get one of those police dogs;
I don’t suppose you got that kind?”

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:31.350
The man peered doubtfully into the basket,
plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling,

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.289
by the back of the neck.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.870
“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:44.770
“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,”
said the man with disappointment in his voice.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:51.300
“It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed
his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.010
“Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s
a dog that’ll never bother you with catching

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:57.690
cold.”

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:04.510
“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson
enthusiastically. “How much is it?”

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:12.370
“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly.
“That dog will cost you ten dollars.”

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.690
The Airedale — undoubtedly there was an
Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.950
its feet were startlingly white — changed
hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.550
lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat
with rapture.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:30.630
“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.410
“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:40.490
“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively.
“Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.710
dogs with it.”

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:48.420
We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and
soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.620
afternoon that I wouldn’t have been surprised
to see a great flock of white sheep turn the

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.660
corner.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.240
“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave
you here.”

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.830
“No, you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.680
“Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come
up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.110
“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone
my sister Catherine. She’s said to be very

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.730
beautiful by people who ought to know.”

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.980
“Well, I’d like to, but ——”

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:23.680
We went on, cutting back again over the Park
toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:30.250
the cab stopped at one slice in a long white
cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.820
homecoming glance around the neighborhood,
Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.630
purchases, and went haughtily in.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.950
“I’m going to have the McKees come up,”
she announced as we rose in the elevator.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:47.770
“And, of course, I got to call up my sister,
too.”

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.420
The apartment was on the top floor — a small
living-room, a small dining-room, a small

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:58.620
bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded
to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:04.600
entirely too large for it, so that to move
about was to stumble continually over scenes

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:11.700
of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles.
The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:17.460
apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.
Looked at from a distance, however, the hen

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:25.480
resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance
of a stout old lady beamed down into the room.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.100
Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the
table together with a copy of Simon Called

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:36.630
Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines
of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:42.400
with the dog. A reluctant elevator-boy went
for a box full of straw and some milk, to

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.020
which he added on his own initiative a tin
of large, hard dog-biscuits — one of which

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:54.399
decomposed apathetically in the saucer of
milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:58.440
out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau
door.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.830
I have been drunk just twice in my life, and
the second time was that afternoon; so everything

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:10.730
that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,
although until after eight o’clock the apartment

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:16.740
was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s
lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.420
the telephone; then there were no cigarettes,
and I went out to buy some at the drugstore

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:28.170
on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared,
so I sat down discreetly in the living-room

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:34.740
and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter — either
it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.310
things, because it didn’t make any sense
to me.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.560
Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink
Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.390
first names) reappeared, company commenced
to arrive at the apartment-door.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:55.000
The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly
girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.130
bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered
milky white. Her eye-brows had been plucked

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:07.350
and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle,
but the efforts of nature toward the restoration

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:13.430
of the old alignment gave a blurred air to
her face. When she moved about there was an

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:18.839
incessant clicking as innumerable pottery
bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:24.130
She came in with such a proprietary haste,
and looked around so possessively at the furniture

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:29.890
that I wondered if she lived here. But when
I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:35.640
my question aloud, and told me she lived with
a girl friend at a hotel.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:41.190
Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the
flat below. He had just shaved, for there

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.300
was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone,
and he was most respectful in his greeting

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:50.890
to every one in the room. He informed me that
he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:56.209
later that he was a photographer and had made
the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s mother

00:13:56.209 --> 00:14:03.290
which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall.
His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:09.730
horrible. She told me with pride that her
husband had photographed her a hundred and

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.279
twenty-seven times since they had been married.

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:19.250
Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time
before, and was now attired in an elaborate

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:25.050
afternoon dress of cream-colored chiffon,
which gave out a continual rustle as she swept

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.800
about the room. With the influence of the
dress her personality had also undergone a

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.860
change. The intense vitality that had been
so remarkable in the garage was converted

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:43.430
into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her
gestures, her assertions became more violently

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:49.660
affected moment by moment, and as she expanded
the room grew smaller around her, until she

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:55.180
seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking
pivot through the smoky air.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.959
“My dear,” she told her sister in a high,
mincing shout, “most of these fellas will

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:06.430
cheat you every time. All they think of is
money. I had a woman up here last week to

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.709
look at my feet, and when she gave me the
bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:11.170
out.”

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:16.240
“What was the name of the woman?” asked
Mrs. McKee.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.010
“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking
at people’s feet in their own homes.”

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:27.390
“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee,
“I think it’s adorable.”

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:31.529
Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising
her eyebrow in disdain.

00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:37.660
“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said.
“I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.550
care what I look like.”

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:46.410
“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know
what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:52.310
Chester could only get you in that pose I
think he could make something of it.”

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:57.860
We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who
removed a strand of hair from over her eyes

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:04.279
and looked back at us with a brilliant smile.
Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:09.790
on one side, and then moved his hand back
and forth slowly in front of his face.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:15.750
“I should change the light,” he said after
a moment. “I’d like to bring out the modelling

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:20.450
of the features. And I’d try to get hold
of all the back hair.”

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:26.870
“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,”
cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s ——”

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:32.670
Her husband said “sh!” and we all looked
at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.709
yawned audibly and got to his feet.

00:16:35.709 --> 00:16:42.519
“You McKees have something to drink,”
he said. “Get some more ice and mineral

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:44.720
water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:52.730
“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle
raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:59.980
of the lower orders. “These people! You
have to keep after them all the time.”

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:05.360
She looked at me and laughed pointlessly.
Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:11.970
it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen,
implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:12.990
there.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:20.130
“I’ve done some nice things out on Long
Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.260
Tom looked at him blankly.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.250
“Two of them we have framed down-stairs.”

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.200
“Two what?” demanded Tom.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:38.049
“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk
Point— The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk

00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:40.970
Point— The Sea.”

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.490
The sister Catherine sat down beside me on
the couch.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:49.740
“Do you live down on Long Island, too?”
she inquired.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.970
“I live at West Egg.”

00:17:52.970 --> 00:18:00.410
“Really? I was down there at a party about
a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.140
you know him?”

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.020
“I live next door to him.”

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.520
“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin
of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.090
his money comes from.”

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.600
“Really?”

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.470
She nodded.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:20.230
“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have
him get anything on me.”

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.110
This absorbing information about my neighbor
was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.370
suddenly at Catherine:

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:33.390
“Chester, I think you could do something
with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.260
only nodded in a bored way, and turned his
attention to Tom.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:45.299
“I’d like to do more work on Long Island,
if I could get the entry. All I ask is that

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:46.580
they should give me a start.”

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:54.410
“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into
a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:59.830
with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter
of introduction, won’t you Myrtle?”

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.160
“Do what?” she asked, startled.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:08.170
“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction
to your husband, so he can do some studies

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:14.920
of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment
as he invented. “George B. Wilson at the

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.360
Gasoline Pump, or something like that.”

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:25.840
Catherine leaned close to me and whispered
in my ear: “Neither of them can stand the

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.690
person they’re married to.”

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.230
“Can’t they?”

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:37.400
“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle
and then at Tom. “What I say is, why go

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.150
on living with them if they can’t stand
them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.610
get married to each other right away.”

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.600
“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:55.350
The answer to this was unexpected. It came
from Myrtle, who had overheard the question,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.480
and it was violent and obscene.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:05.049
“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly.
She lowered her voice again. “It’s really

00:20:05.049 --> 00:20:12.650
his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s
a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:18.110
Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little
shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:23.090
“When they do get married,” continued
Catherine, “they’re going West to live

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.480
for a while until it blows over.”

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.220
“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:36.610
“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed
surprisingly. “I just got back from Monte

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.540
Carlo.”

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.470
“Really.”

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:44.230
“Just last year. I went over there with
another girl.” “Stay long?”

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:50.720
“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back.
We went by way of Marseilles. We had over

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.400
twelve hundred dollars when we started, but
we got gypped out of it all in two days in

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:02.110
the private rooms. We had an awful time getting
back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.840
town!”

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:10.490
The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window
for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:16.100
— then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called
me back into the room.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:22.700
“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared
vigorously. “I almost married a little kyke

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:28.990
who’d been after me for years. I knew he
was below me. Everybody kept saying to me:

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:34.400
‘Lucille, that man’s ‘way below you!’
But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.110
me sure.”

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:41.650
“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson,
nodding her head up and down, “at least

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.160
you didn’t marry him.”

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.169
“I know I didn’t.”

00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:52.120
“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously.
“And that’s the difference between your

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.309
case and mine.”

00:21:53.309 --> 00:22:01.070
“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine.
“Nobody forced you to.”

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.160
Myrtle considered.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:10.669
“I married him because I thought he was
a gentleman,” she said finally. “I thought

00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:16.160
he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t
fit to lick my shoe.”

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.830
“You were crazy about him for a while,”
said Catherine.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:30.320
“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously.
“Who said I was crazy about him? I never

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.620
was any more crazy about him than I was about
that man there.”

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:41.530
She pointed suddenly at me, and every one
looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.270
my expression that I had played no part in
her past.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:52.960
“The only crazy I was was when I married
him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.530
borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married
in, and never even told me about it, and the

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:07.230
man came after it one day when he was out.
‘oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘this

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:13.990
is the first I ever heard about it.’ But
I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.309
to beat the band all afternoon.”

00:23:16.309 --> 00:23:22.360
“She really ought to get away from him,”
resumed Catherine to me. “They’ve been

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:29.100
living over that garage for eleven years.
And tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.”

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:35.070
The bottle of whiskey — a second one — was
now in constant demand by all present, excepting

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:41.460
Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing
at all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:48.520
him for some celebrated sandwiches, which
were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:54.370
to get out and walk southward toward the park
through the soft twilight, but each time I

00:23:54.370 --> 00:24:00.429
tried to go I became entangled in some wild,
strident argument which pulled me back, as

00:24:00.429 --> 00:24:06.950
if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over
the city our line of yellow windows must have

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:13.190
contributed their share of human secrecy to
the casual watcher in the darkening streets,

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:20.580
and I was him too, looking up and wondering.
I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.270
and repelled by the inexhaustible variety
of life.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.530
Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and
suddenly her warm breath poured over me the

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.460
story of her first meeting with Tom.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:39.780
“It was on the two little seats facing each
other that are always the last ones left on

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:47.179
the train. I was going up to New York to see
my sister and spend the night. He had on a

00:24:47.179 --> 00:24:53.520
dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I
couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:59.990
time he looked at me I had to pretend to be
looking at the advertisement over his head.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:06.100
When we came into the station he was next
to me, and his white shirt-front pressed against

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:14.000
my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call
a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.830
excited that when I got into a taxi with him
I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:26.750
into a subway train. All I kept thinking about,
over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever;

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.660
you can’t live forever.’”

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:35.910
She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang
full of her artificial laughter.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:40.760
“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to
give you this dress as soon as I’m through

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.309
with it. I’ve got to get another one to-morrow.
I’m going to make a list of all the things

00:25:45.309 --> 00:25:51.640
I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave, and
a collar for the dog, and one of those cute

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.799
little ash-trays where you touch a spring,
and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s

00:25:56.799 --> 00:26:02.350
grave that’ll last all summer. I got to
write down a list so I won’t forget all

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.590
the things I got to do.”

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:10.510
It was nine o’clock — almost immediately
afterward I looked at my watch and found it

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:17.950
was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with
his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:23.990
of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief
I wiped from his cheek the remains of the

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:29.169
spot of dried lather that had worried me all
the afternoon.

00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:33.490
The little dog was sitting on the table looking
with blind eyes through the smoke, and from

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:40.820
time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared,
reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:47.450
then lost each other, searched for each other,
found each other a few feet away. Some time

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:53.309
toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson
stood face to face discussing, in impassioned

00:26:53.309 --> 00:26:58.320
voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right
to mention Daisy’s name.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:05.690
“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson.
“I’ll say it whenever I want to! Daisy!

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:06.510
Dai ——”

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:13.950
Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan
broke her nose with his open hand.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:19.000
Then there were bloody towels upon the bath-room
floor, and women’s voices scolding, and

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:26.179
high over the confusion a long broken wail
of pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and

00:27:26.179 --> 00:27:32.470
started in a daze toward the door. When he
had gone half way he turned around and stared

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:38.500
at the scene — his wife and Catherine scolding
and consoling as they stumbled here and there

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:44.830
among the crowded furniture with articles
of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:50.000
bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a
copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:58.280
of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued
on out the door. Taking my hat from the chandelier,

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.580
I followed.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:06.200
“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested,
as we groaned down in the elevator.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.460
“Where?”

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.730
“Anywhere.”

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:14.360
“Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped
the elevator boy.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:20.820
“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with
dignity, “I didn’t know I was touching

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.909
it.”

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:29.009
“All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad
to.”

00:28:29.009 --> 00:28:34.740
. . . I was standing beside his bed and he
was sitting up between the sheets, clad in

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.150
his underwear, with a great portfolio in his
hands.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:49.919
“Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old
Grocery Horse . . . Brook’n Bridge. . . . ”

00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:57.970
Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower
level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.919
at the morning Tribune, and waiting for the
four o’clock train.
