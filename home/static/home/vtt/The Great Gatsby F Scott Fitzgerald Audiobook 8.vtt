00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.620
Chapter 8

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.910
I couldn’t sleep all night; a fog-horn was
groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.490
half-sick between grotesque reality and savage,
frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.349
taxi go up Gatsby’s drive, and immediately
I jumped out of bed and began to dress — I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.769
felt that I had something to tell him, something
to warn him about, and morning would be too

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.600
late.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.690
Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door
was still open and he was leaning against

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.190
a table in the hall, heavy with dejection
or sleep.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.780
“Nothing happened,” he said wanly. “I
waited, and about four o’clock she came

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.820
to the window and stood there for a minute
and then turned out the light.”

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.990
His house had never seemed so enormous to
me as it did that night when we hunted through

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:09.110
the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed
aside curtains that were like pavilions, and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.130
felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for
electric light switches — once I tumbled

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.109
with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly
piano. There was an inexplicable amount of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.700
dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty,
as though they hadn’t been aired for many

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.189
days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar
table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.189
Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room,
we sat smoking out into the darkness.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.789
“You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s
pretty certain they’ll trace your car.”

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.889
“Go away now, old sport?”

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:53.869
“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to
Montreal.”

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.450
He wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly
leave Daisy until he knew what she was going

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.380
to do. He was clutching at some last hope
and I couldn’t bear to shake him free.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.350
It was this night that he told me the strange
story of his youth with Dan Cody — told

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.780
it to me because “Jay Gatsby.” had broken
up like glass against Tom’s hard malice,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.709
and the long secret extravaganza was played
out. I think that he would have acknowledged

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.849
anything now, without reserve, but he wanted
to talk about Daisy.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.680
She was the first “nice” girl he had ever
known. In various unrevealed capacities he

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.069
had come in contact with such people, but
always with indiscernible barbed wire between.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.260
He found her excitingly desirable. He went
to her house, at first with other officers

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.069
from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him
— he had never been in such a beautiful

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.349
house before, but what gave it an air of breathless
intensity, was that Daisy lived there — it

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:06.340
was as casual a thing to her as his tent out
at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.329
about it, a hint of bedrooms up-stairs more
beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.049
gay and radiant activities taking place through
its corridors, and of romances that were not

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.400
musty and laid away already in lavender but
fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.730
shining motor-cars and of dances whose flowers
were scarcely withered. It excited him, too,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.849
that many men had already loved Daisy — it
increased her value in his eyes. He felt their

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.530
presence all about the house, pervading the
air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.530
emotions.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.939
But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house
by a colossal accident. However glorious might

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:57.980
be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present
a penniless young man without a past, and

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.310
at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform
might slip from his shoulders. So he made

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:12.249
the most of his time. He took what he could
get, ravenously and unscrupulously — eventually

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:19.269
he took Daisy one still October night, took
her because he had no real right to touch

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.579
her hand.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.720
He might have despised himself, for he had
certainly taken her under false pretenses.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.660
I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom
millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.770
a sense of security; he let her believe that
he was a person from much the same stratum

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.889
as herself — that he was fully able to take
care of her. As a matter of fact, he had no

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.259
such facilities — he had no comfortable
family standing behind him, and he was liable

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.729
at the whim of an impersonal government to
be blown anywhere about the world.

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:59.150
But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t
turn out as he had imagined. He had intended,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.180
probably, to take what he could and go — but
now he found that he had committed himself

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.240
to the following of a grail. He knew that
Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.990
just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could
be. She vanished into her rich house, into

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:30.449
her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby — nothing.
He felt married to her, that was all.

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.800
When they met again, two days later, it was
Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.020
betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought
luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.789
squeaked fashionably as she turned toward
him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:54.300
She had caught a cold, and it made her voice
huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.710
was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and
mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.610
of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy,
gleaming like silver, safe and proud above

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.310
the hot struggles of the poor.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.840
“I can’t describe to you how surprised
I was to find out I loved her, old sport.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.099
I even hoped for a while that she’d throw
me over, but she didn’t, because she was

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:31.070
in love with me too. She thought I knew a
lot because I knew different things from her.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:38.389
. . . Well, there I was, ‘way off my ambitions,
getting deeper in love every minute, and all

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.770
of a sudden I didn’t care. What was the
use of doing great things if I could have

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:50.460
a better time telling her what I was going
to do?” On the last afternoon before he

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.280
went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms
for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.490
day, with fire in the room and her cheeks
flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.919
his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark
shining hair. The afternoon had made them

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.919
tranquil for a while, as if to give them a
deep memory for the long parting the next

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:20.800
day promised. They had never been closer in
their month of love, nor communicated more

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.580
profoundly one with another, than when she
brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:35.110
or when he touched the end of her fingers,
gently, as though she were asleep.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.409
He did extraordinarily well in the war. He
was a captain before he went to the front,

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:45.460
and following the Argonne battles he got his
majority and the command of the divisional

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:51.659
machine-guns. After the Armistice he tried
frantically to get home, but some complication

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:58.689
or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead.
He was worried now — there was a quality

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:05.330
of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She
didn’t see why he couldn’t come. She was

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.939
feeling the pressure of the world outside,
and she wanted to see him and feel his presence

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:16.159
beside her and be reassured that she was doing
the right thing after all.

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:21.289
For Daisy was young and her artificial world
was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful

00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:28.150
snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm
of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:36.190
of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones
wailed the hopeless comment of the Beale Street

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:43.510
Blues while a hundred pairs of golden and
silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:49.180
At the gray tea hour there were always rooms
that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:55.600
fever, while fresh faces drifted here and
there like rose petals blown by the sad horns

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.180
around the floor.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:04.709
Through this twilight universe Daisy began
to move again with the season; suddenly she

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:09.089
was again keeping half a dozen dates a day
with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep

00:09:09.089 --> 00:09:14.680
at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening
dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:22.000
beside her bed. And all the time something
within her was crying for a decision. She

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.200
wanted her life shaped now, immediately — and
the decision must be made by some force — of

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.720
love, of money, of unquestionable practicality
— that was close at hand.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.250
That force took shape in the middle of spring
with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:46.300
a wholesome bulkiness about his person and
his position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:52.500
there was a certain struggle and a certain
relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.380
was still at Oxford.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.860
It was dawn now on Long Island and we went
about opening the rest of the windows down-stairs,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:08.649
filling the house with gray-turning, gold-turning
light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:15.769
across the dew and ghostly birds began to
sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow,

00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:22.360
pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind,
promising a cool, lovely day.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:28.630
“I don’t think she ever loved him.”
Gatsby turned around from a window and looked

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:35.610
at me challengingly. “You must remember,
old sport, she was very excited this afternoon.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.079
He told her those things in a way that frightened
her — that made it look as if I was some

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:47.079
kind of cheap sharper. And the result was
she hardly knew what she was saying.”

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:49.320
He sat down gloomily.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.449
“Of course she might have loved him just
for a minute, when they were first married

00:10:54.449 --> 00:11:00.010
— and loved me more even then, do you see?”

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.670
Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:09.690
“In any case,” he said, “it was just
personal.”

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:16.880
What could you make of that, except to suspect
some intensity in his conception of the affair

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.180
that couldn’t be measured?

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.630
He came back from France when Tom and Daisy
were still on their wedding trip, and made

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:31.620
a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville
on the last of his army pay. He stayed there

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.980
a week, walking the streets where their footsteps
had clicked together through the November

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:42.950
night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places
to which they had driven in her white car.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.029
Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed
to him more mysterious and gay than other

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:52.930
houses, so his idea of the city itself, even
though she was gone from it, was pervaded

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.360
with a melancholy beauty.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.889
He left feeling that if he had searched harder,
he might have found her — that he was leaving

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:09.600
her behind. The day-coach — he was penniless
now — was hot. He went out to the open vestibule

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.470
and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station
slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:21.880
moved by. Then out into the spring fields,
where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:27.560
with people in it who might once have seen
the pale magic of her face along the casual

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.040
street.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.490
The track curved and now it was going away
from the sun, which as it sank lower, seemed

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:41.000
to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing
city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.829
out his hand desperately as if to snatch only
a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:53.170
that she had made lovely for him. But it was
all going by too fast now for his blurred

00:12:53.170 --> 00:13:02.250
eyes and he knew that he had lost that part
of it, the freshest and the best, forever.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:07.769
It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast
and went out on the porch. The night had made

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:13.130
a sharp difference in the weather and there
was an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener,

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.740
the last one of Gatsby’s former servants,
came to the foot of the steps.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:23.079
“I’m going to drain the pool to-day, Mr.
Gatsby. Leaves’ll start falling pretty soon,

00:13:23.079 --> 00:13:25.040
and then there’s always trouble with the
pipes.”

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:32.829
“Don’t do it to-day,” Gatsby answered.
He turned to me apologetically. “You know,

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:36.949
old sport, I’ve never used that pool all
summer?”

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:40.050
I looked at my watch and stood up.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.399
“Twelve minutes to my train.”

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:47.610
I didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t
worth a decent stroke of work, but it was

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:54.190
more than that — I didn’t want to leave
Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.060
before I could get myself away.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.470
“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.779
“Do, old sport.”

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:04.820
“I’ll call you about noon.”

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.540
We walked slowly down the steps.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:15.160
“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked
at me anxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.959
this.

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:19.290
“I suppose so.”

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:23.420
“Well, good-by.”

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.690
We shook hands and I started away. Just before
I reached the hedge I remembered something

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.360
and turned around.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:36.930
“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted
across the lawn. “You’re worth the whole

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.630
damn bunch put together.”

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:46.839
I’ve always been glad I said that. It was
the only compliment I ever gave him, because

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:55.180
I disapproved of him from beginning to end.
First he nodded politely, and then his face

00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:01.610
broke into that radiant and understanding
smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:08.829
on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink
rag of a suit made a bright spot of color

00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:14.579
against the white steps, and I thought of
the night when I first came to his ancestral

00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:21.100
home, three months before. The lawn and drive
had been crowded with the faces of those who

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:28.110
guessed at his corruption — and he had stood
on those steps, concealing his incorruptible

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.269
dream, as he waved them good-by.

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:39.509
I thanked him for his hospitality. We were
always thanking him for that — I and the

00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:40.470
others.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:46.490
“Good-by,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast,
Gatsby.”

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.779
Up in the city, I tried for a while to list
the quotations on an interminable amount of

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:58.250
stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.
Just before noon the phone woke me, and I

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:04.360
started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead.
It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.910
at this hour because the uncertainty of her
own movements between hotels and clubs and

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:15.550
private houses made her hard to find in any
other way. Usually her voice came over the

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:20.970
wire as something fresh and cool, as if a
divot from a green golf-links had come sailing

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.940
in at the office window, but this morning
it seemed harsh and dry.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:31.740
“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said.
“I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going down

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.310
to Southampton this afternoon.”

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:40.560
Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s
house, but the act annoyed me, and her next

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.470
remark made me rigid.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.610
“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.459
“How could it have mattered then?”

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:53.600
Silence for a moment. Then:

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.810
“However — I want to see you.”

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.509
“I want to see you, too.”

00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:06.390
“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and
come into town this afternoon?”

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.920
“No — I don’t think this afternoon.”

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.530
“Very well.”

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.550
“It’s impossible this afternoon. Various
——”

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:21.160
We talked like that for a while, and then
abruptly we weren’t talking any longer.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:27.520
I don’t know which of us hung up with a
sharp click, but I know I didn’t care. I

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.860
couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table
that day if I never talked to her again in

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.500
this world.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:40.710
I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later,
but the line was busy. I tried four times;

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.350
finally an exasperated central told me the
wire was being kept open for long distance

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:51.340
from Detroit. Taking out my time-table, I
drew a small circle around the three-fifty

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:59.250
train. Then I leaned back in my chair and
tried to think. It was just noon.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.210
When I passed the ashheaps on the train that
morning I had crossed deliberately to the

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:09.650
other side of the car. I suppose there’d
be a curious crowd around there all day with

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:14.840
little boys searching for dark spots in the
dust, and some garrulous man telling over

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:20.160
and over what had happened, until it became
less and less real even to him and he could

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:27.440
tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic
achievement was forgotten. Now I want to go

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:33.470
back a little and tell what happened at the
garage after we left there the night before.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:38.480
They had difficulty in locating the sister,
Catherine. She must have broken her rule against

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.910
drinking that night, for when she arrived
she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:49.330
that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing.
When they convinced her of this, she immediately

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:56.290
fainted, as if that was the intolerable part
of the affair. Some one, kind or curious,

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:01.620
took her in his car and drove her in the wake
of her sister’s body.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.810
Until long after midnight a changing crowd
lapped up against the front of the garage,

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:12.370
while George Wilson rocked himself back and
forth on the couch inside. For a while the

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:17.190
door of the office was open, and every one
who came into the garage glanced irresistibly

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:23.690
through it. Finally someone said it was a
shame, and closed the door. Michaelis and

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:30.270
several other men were with him; first, four
or five men, later two or three men. Still

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:35.170
later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger
to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:40.420
he went back to his own place and made a pot
of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.450
with Wilson until dawn.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:49.460
About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s
incoherent muttering changed — he grew quieter

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.970
and began to talk about the yellow car. He
announced that he had a way of finding out

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.390
whom the yellow car belonged to, and then
he blurted out that a couple of months ago

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:04.550
his wife had come from the city with her face
bruised and her nose swollen.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:11.970
But when he heard himself say this, he flinched
and began to cry “Oh, my God!” again in

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:17.950
his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy
attempt to distract him.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:24.280
“How long have you been married, George?
Come on there, try and sit still a minute

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.520
and answer my question. How long have you
been married?”

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.620
“Twelve years.”

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:38.440
“Ever had any children? Come on, George,
sit still — I asked you a question. Did

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.700
you ever have any children?”

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.850
The hard brown beetles kept thudding against
the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.880
a car go tearing along the road outside it
sounded to him like the car that hadn’t

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:57.280
stopped a few hours before. He didn’t like
to go into the garage, because the work bench

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.930
was stained where the body had been lying,
so he moved uncomfortably around the office

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:08.560
— he knew every object in it before morning
— and from time to time sat down beside

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.950
Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:18.710
“Have you got a church you go to sometimes,
George? Maybe even if you haven’t been there

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:25.790
for a long time? Maybe I could call up the
church and get a priest to come over and he

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.100
could talk to you, see?”

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.140
“Don’t belong to any.”

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:37.600
“You ought to have a church, George, for
times like this. You must have gone to church

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:45.320
once. Didn’t you get married in a church?
Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.800
get married in a church?”

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.980
“That was a long time ago.”

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:58.790
The effort of answering broke the rhythm of
his rocking — for a moment he was silent.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:04.880
Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered
look came back into his faded eyes.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.850
“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing
at the desk.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.350
“Which drawer?”

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.850
“That drawer — that one.”

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:19.900
Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand.
There was nothing in it but a small, expensive

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.810
dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver.
It was apparently new.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.420
“This?” he inquired, holding it up.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.560
Wilson stared and nodded.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:37.750
“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried
to tell me about it, but I knew it was something

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.370
funny.”

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.080
“You mean your wife bought it?”

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.670
“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her
bureau.”

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:52.560
Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that,
and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:58.620
wife might have bought the dog-leash. But
conceivably Wilson had heard some of these

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:05.460
same explanations before, from Myrtle, because
he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.930
a whisper — his comforter left several explanations
in the air.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:18.290
“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His
mouth dropped open suddenly.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.450
“Who did?”

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.820
“I have a way of finding out.”

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:31.020
“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend.
“This has been a strain to you and you don’t

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:35.600
know what you’re saying. You’d better
try and sit quiet till morning.”

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.130
“He murdered her.”

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.560
“It was an accident, George.”

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.740
Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and
his mouth widened slightly with the ghost

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.160
of a superior “Hm!”

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:57.280
“I know,” he said definitely, “I’m
one of these trusting fellas and I don’t

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:05.110
think any harm to nobody, but when I get to
know a thing I know it. It was the man in

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:11.210
that car. She ran out to speak to him and
he wouldn’t stop.”

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.900
Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t
occurred to him that there was any special

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:22.000
significance in it. He believed that Mrs.
Wilson had been running away from her husband,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.350
rather than trying to stop any particular
car.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.510
“How could she of been like that?”

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:38.600
“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as
if that answered the question. “Ah-h-h ——”

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.730
He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood
twisting the leash in his hand.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:51.220
“Maybe you got some friend that I could
telephone for, George?”

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.830
This was a forlorn hope — he was almost
sure that Wilson had no friend: there was

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:03.030
not enough of him for his wife. He was glad
a little later when he noticed a change in

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:08.910
the room, a blue quickening by the window,
and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.950
five o’clock it was blue enough outside
to snap off the light.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:20.110
Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps,
where small gray clouds took on fantastic

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:24.710
shape and scurried here and there in the faint
dawn wind.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:33.110
“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a
long silence. “I told her she might fool

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:41.210
me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her
to the window.”— with an effort he got

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:46.290
up and walked to the rear window and leaned
with his face pressed against it ——” and

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:53.240
I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing,
everything you’ve been doing. You may fool

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.240
me, but you can’t fool God!’”

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.570
Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a
shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:08.640
T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale
and enormous, from the dissolving night.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.480
“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:21.370
“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis
assured him. Something made him turn away

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:27.340
from the window and look back into the room.
But Wilson stood there a long time, his face

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:32.640
close to the window pane, nodding into the
twilight.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.540
By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and
grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.570
It was one of the watchers of the night before
who had promised to come back, so he cooked

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:48.630
breakfast for three, which he and the other
man ate together. Wilson was quieter now,

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:53.710
and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he
awoke four hours later and hurried back to

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.030
the garage, Wilson was gone.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:02.880
His movements — he was on foot all the time
— were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.130
and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought
a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:12.450
of coffee. He must have been tired and walking
slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:17.120
until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty
in accounting for his time — there were

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.970
boys who had seen a man “acting sort of
crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:29.940
oddly from the side of the road. Then for
three hours he disappeared from view. The

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.990
police, on the strength of what he said to
Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:41.550
out,” supposed that he spent that time going
from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:48.490
for a yellow car. On the other hand, no garage
man who had seen him ever came forward, and

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:54.790
perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding
out what he wanted to know. By half-past two

00:27:54.790 --> 00:28:00.680
he was in West Egg, where he asked someone
the way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.240
he knew Gatsby’s name.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:09.760
At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit
and left word with the butler that if any

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.480
one phoned word was to be brought to him at
the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.820
mattress that had amused his guests during
the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:26.080
it up. Then he gave instructions that the
open car wasn’t to be taken out under any

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:33.030
circumstances — and this was strange, because
the front right fender needed repair.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:37.910
Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started
for the pool. Once he stopped and shifted

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:42.640
it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if
he needed help, but he shook his head and

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.680
in a moment disappeared among the yellowing
trees.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:52.660
No telephone message arrived, but the butler
went without his sleep and waited for it until

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:59.860
four o’clock — until long after there
was any one to give it to if it came. I have

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:07.290
an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe
it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:16.140
If that was true he must have felt that he
had lost the old warm world, paid a high price

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:23.280
for living too long with a single dream. He
must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:31.240
frightening leaves and shivered as he found
what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:39.510
the sunlight was upon the scarcely created
grass. A new world, material without being

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:48.610
real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams
like air, drifted fortuitously about . . . like

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:57.080
that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward
him through the amorphous trees.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.920
The chauffeur — he was one of Wolfsheim’s
proteges — heard the shots — afterward

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:08.120
he could only say that he hadn’t thought
anything much about them. I drove from the

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.110
station directly to Gatsby’s house and my
rushing anxiously up the front steps was the

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:19.790
first thing that alarmed any one. But they
knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:27.110
a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler,
gardener, and I, hurried down to the pool.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:32.300
There was a faint, barely perceptible movement
of the water as the fresh flow from one end

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:38.950
urged its way toward the drain at the other
with little ripples that were hardly the shadows

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:47.030
of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly
down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:52.470
corrugated the surface was enough to disturb
its accidental course with its accidental

00:30:52.470 --> 00:31:01.030
burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved
it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass,

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.430
a thin red circle in the water.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:10.480
It was after we started with Gatsby toward
the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:15.970
body a little way off in the grass, and the
holocaust was complete.
