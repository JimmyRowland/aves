<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="moretext">Show</a>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded">A Co-op is where people come together with a common cause or idea and share their resources towards achieving this end. In Co-ops, members work together and share in all the organizations responsibilities so that costs can be kept low. The resulting savings are used to benefit the members by increasing facilities and maintaining low costs. There are different types of Co-ops in the USA and around the world besides housing Co-ops, such as day-care, credit unions, food, dining co-ops...etc.</span>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="moretext">Show</a>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded">The UCHA Co-op is a member-run organization that offers affordable Housing to UCLA and other full-time students. A pivotal factor and benefit of the UCHA is that it keeps facilities basic, so as to reduce on overall expenses, and thereby offer affordable (room and board) rates to students needing cheap housing. The organization consists of over 400 students from the United States and around the world. All members who live here participate in the functioning of the organization by contributing approximately 4 hours per week of their time in various departments of the organization. Some examples of these departments are: Food service, facilities (i.e. maintenance and clean-up), bathroom cleaning, social activities, office etc. All chore assignments are flexible, and are based around a students schedule. All students living at the UCHA Co-op are considered members and part-owners of the Association. Members are encouraged to volunteer their ideas as well as their time in improving the organization and to make it a fun living environment. The UCHA Co-op provides basic facilities to students such as food and utilities. In addition, all rooms are equipped with a bed, closet, curtain, desk and desk chair. We do not provide air-conditioning or fans. Members are required to bring all personal items (towels, soap etc.), or they may purchase them in shops nearby. The UCHA Co-op is located within walking distance of the UCLA campus in cosmopolitan Westwood.</span>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded">Just fill out an application and attach it with your student status information (i.e. valid School ID, Admission letter) and payment of the application fee (minimum payments i.e. US$35.00). The deposit fee and the membership fee is not required until the day of check-in by the member. The application fee may be paid by cash, money order or bank draft, which needs to be included with the application. You may also write the number of your credit card at the back of your application, along with the expiry date and the amount you want debited. Also be sure to indicate if you want your application processed "express". We do not accept wire transfers or payments by PayPal. You can send the application by:
<ul style="list-style: circle; margin-left: 50px;">
	<li>Fax: (310) 824-0112</li>
	<li>E-mail: uchaweb@earthlink.net, or</li>

<span class="text-bold">Q5: How are students admitted to the UCHA (Co-op)?</span>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="moretext">Show</a>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded"><p>Admission is generally on a rolling basis; there are no application deadlines. But priority is given to UCLA students. Prospective residents are required to turn in the application with the $35 fee. <span class="text-bold">Regular</span> processing of an application will take approximately between 2 to 4 weeks (<span class="text-bold">Express</span> processing will take 5 business days). <span class="text-underline">Please Do Not send more than one application.</span> You only pay one application fee per application. All applications must be manually signed, not typed in, and sent in with proof of student status (i.e. copy of Id, admission letter, I-20 etc.).</p>
<p>Applicants will be contacted only <span class="text-underline">after</span> the application has been processed (during the above-mentioned period) and given a result (i.e. admitted, denied, or waitlisted). The UCHA may not contact you prior to formal approval.</p>
If approved, UCHA (the office of the Executive Director) will contact (write or E-mail) the applicant informing of his/her admission and requiring confirmation from the applicant by payment of the reservation fee. This fee, while non-refundable, will be credited towards the first room and board contribution (payment) of the quarter, and will need to be paid by the due date as specified by UCHA. On receipt of the reservation fee, UCHA will inform applicant of his/her reservation, and specify the official check-in date. On the date of check-in, the newly admitted member is required to make payment of the deposit, membership fee, and any early check-in charges (if any) as well. The member fee is a <span class="text-bold">one-time</span> fee, to join the Association. The security deposit is refundable, and kept for the entire duration of your stay at the UCHA. It will be forwarded to the member after official check-out on request.</span>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded">The UCHA has no application deadlines and admission is on a rolling basis (i.e. vacancies filled on a first-come, first-served basis), until all vacancies are filled. Priority is given to UCLA students, and returning members. All applicants are advised to apply early before the quarter you want admission for, especially if you are seeking Fall admission. However, the UCHA does accept applications even after the quarter has begun depending on vacancies. An application takes 2-4 weeks for processing (depending on the time of year). However, you could ask for an application to be processed "express" which will be done within five business days. The express fee is $20.00 and is in addition to the $35.00 application fee. Returning members must apply no later than 6 weeks prior to the check-in date of the quarter you want admission for.</span>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="moretext">Show</a>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded">Prior to check-in, you should have made the following payments: Application fee (US$35.00-Non-Refundable), reservation (room and board) fee ($600.00 Non-refundable). The $1,200.00 deposit and the $200.00 (Non-Refundable) member-fee will need to be paid at the time of check-in along with any early check-in charges. For check-ins (within two weeks) prior to the official check-in date, there is a charge of US$25.00 a day until the official check-in date. For any check-ins beyond two weeks (prior to the official check-in date) payment will be on a *weekly pro-rated basis (*i.e. the price per week is the same whether a check-in is on a Monday or on a Friday).</span>

<br />
<span class="expanded">All non-cash payments should be addressed to "UCHA". Our mailing address is: 500 Landfair Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90024. For payments by credit card, you would need to send a fax or email stating that you authorize the UCHA to debit your card, and specify the credit card information: the card number, expiration date, last three digits of the security code (found on the reverse of the card) and the amount you want debited.

<span class="expanded">While the UCHA reserves the right to rescind/withdraw an offer of housing (and/or make changes to it's policies), but assuming no cancellation is in force, a place can only be considered guaranteed, once you have met the following criteria:
<ul style="list-style: circle; margin-left: 50px;">
	<li>you have been officially admitted</li>
	<li>you have paid the reservation fee by the due date</li>
	<li>you are in receipt of official confirmation from the UCHA (in writing) stating that we have reserved a place for you</li>

<span class="expanded">The application fee must be sent in with the official application. If you are paying by credit card there is a section on the second page of the application form for you to write in card details. If paying by money order, simply enclose the payment. Do Not Send in Cash. For reservation payments, you could make your reservation payment by cash, credit card, travelers' check or money order/bank draft. If you wish to pay by credit card, you would need to send us a letter/email/fax stating that you authorize the UCHA to debit your card, and specify the full card#, amount, expiry date and security code (last three digits found at the back of the card). You can also mail in your payment, or pay in person. Please note, we take Visa or Mastercard only. We Do Not accept wire transfers. Also note, the $600 reservation fee is part of your first room and board payment and is aside of the security deposit. The security deposit (currently $1,200), will be required at check-in.</span>

<br />
<span class="expanded">Non-UCLA students (i.e. SMC, UCLA Extension, CalState schools etc.), or students attending UCLA professional schools may check-in at any time during the week in accordance with their respective school schedule. However, as the UCHA co-op structures its quarterly schedule around the UCLA undergraduate school schedule, so is the billing period. As such, while non-UCLA students may come in mid-quarter, such students would be responsible for room and board (rents) in accordance with the regular co-op billing cycle. If the non-UCLA member's school schedule should end mid-quarter of the co-op billing period, such a member would still be responsible for room and board payments until the end of the UCHA co-op quarter.</span>

<span class="expanded">All contracts are for one quarter (approximately eleven weeks), or at least one session in the summer, and automatically renewable unless canceled. Residents are responsible for the entire quarters room and board payments regardless of the actual days spent at UCHA.

<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded"><p>Usually, you would check-in on the official check-in day of each quarter. However, if you needed to check-in mid-quarter or at any other time earlier or later, that is possible, but you need to first confirm the dates with the office by <span class="text-underline">emailing</span> the official address. Members who want to increase their seniority may also check-in earlier to the official check-in day. Please note however, you may check-in only after receiving written confirmation of a space for you. All check-ins need to be during official hours: M-F 10:00AM - 6:00PM. We are closed on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, so, please email (<a href="mailto:coopaccounting@yahoo.com">uchaweb@earthlink.net</a>) to confirm holiday schedule or check this website (SERVICES section for holiday schedule details).</p>
If you check-in within two weeks of the official check-in date, then the early check-in charge is @$25/day. If you want to come in even prior to that, then you will be billed a pro-rated rate (see RATES section). All early check-in fees include food and utilities, and require that you perform your weekly chore option, and all other obligations, as per your contract/rules of the Association.</span>

<br />
<span class="expanded">UCHA is a student cooperative; hence, all room selections are made by each member according to their individual seniority. When you check-in however, you will be assigned a temporary room, until you pick your permanent room. These selections are usually made during the second or third week of each quarter (as per the UCLA calendar) during the official process called "BUMP". Bump is a special day when students gather to select the rooms of their choice See Q30 for details). These selections are made according to each member's seniority, where the most senior members are called upon first to make their selections followed by members of lesser seniority. Members may also improve their chances by group bumping which means teaming up with other senior members, or checking-in prior to the official check-in day. If you group bump, the seniority of your group is averaged. Seniority is defined as the number of days a member has actually lived at the UCHA co-op. Most new students usually live in a triple the first quarter of their residence at the co-op. For more information please call the front office.</span>

<span class="expanded">The UCHA does offer a limited amount of parking spots to members. Parking may be obtained only after you officially check-in, and not anytime before. All (parking) assignments are competitive and are issued based on a member's seniority in the organization. As such, new members should expect to obtain parking on campus or park on the streets around the first two quarter's of their residence at the UCHA, until such time as they are able to compete for and obtain a spot. You may however, apply for a temporary spot, and this (if obtained) will only be offerd until the scheduled Bump day.</span>

<span class="expanded">During the quarter,we offer 19 meals per week (Monday through Friday: Breakfast Lunch Dinner, and Saturday/Sunday: Lunch and Dinner). Meals (19/week), are part of the quarterly room and board charge (i.e. rent) and are not separated according to individual circumstances. Should you not be available during these times you may ask a fellow member to save a plate for you. Meals served during the break or outside of posted hours (if any), are a curtsey, and are not part of the quarterly contract. Such services depend on staff and member availability, and are at the discretion of the UCHA. We <span class="text-underline">do not</span> permit members to prepare/cook their own meals instead of participating in our meal plan.</span>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="moretext">Show</a>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded"><p>All first quarter members are required to help-out (do their chore requirement) in one of three areas: Kitchen, Facilities and Security. A member may transfer to a different crew (i.e. Office, Co-op store, social etc.) the second quarter and after.</p>
<p>Explanation of Shifts:</p>
<p><span class="text-bold">Kitchen:</span> The kitchen is open for service from 6:00am each morning (starts at 8:00am on the weekends) till 10:00pm each night (ends at 9:00pm on the weekends). Members will select a specific day and time (at check-in), to work in any four-hour time slot (i.e. shift) each week. The time slots available are based on the needs of the department. You may continue to do your chore at the same time each week unless you need to change your time or crew. Working in the kitchen usually entails helping in serving food, washing dishes, pots/pans, preparing salad items and a variety of clean-up projects(i.e. mopping,sweeping etc). All students work under the direction of a supervisor popularly known as the KC (Kitchen Chief).</p>
<p><span class="text-bold">Facilities:</span> Here too each member works under the direct supervision of the manager or supervisor for the day. Projects include fixing and assembling furniture, painting, and assisting the full-time staff with a variety of miscellaneous duties. Duties also include: Sweeping/Mopping the public areas of all three buildings,emptying trash,vacuuming etc.</p>
<span class="text-bold">Security:</span> All shifts are in the evening/early morning (i.e. 11:00pm to 6:00am) and crew members work largely unsupervised. Duties include patrolling the buildings and monitoring the presence of non-members. Additionally, crew members may be requested to work extra hours at special events.</span>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="moretext">Show</a>
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded">No. We do not give out specific rooms. As rooms are given out on a seniority basis, all singles, and most of the doubles are taken by the members who have been here a longer time. It takes approximately two years to have a reasonable chance of competing for a single, and approximately two quarters to have a reasonable chance of getting a double. Usually a new member moves into a triple until they have enough seniority to Bump to the room of their choice. As such, if you want to live with a friend in a double or in any other room, you will need to check-out your chances during the formal process (i.e. at Bump). The admissions office does not involve itself in securing a specific room for a resident. It is all confirmed through the official Bump process and is upto the individual resident to secure the room or roommate of their choice at "BUMP." (see Q30: for more details).</span>

<br />
<span class="expanded">A Triple is one room shared by 3 roomates, a Double is one room shared by 2 roommates etc. Room size varies depending upon the building you live in. However, the average sizes are:
<ul style="list-style: circle; margin-left: 50px;">
	<li>Triple - 11' x 20'.4"</li>
	<li>Double - 10'.8" x 18'.2"</li>

<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="lesstext">Hide</a>
<br />
<span class="expanded">Bump is the day a new resident obtains his/her permanent room. On an assigned date (Usually the second or third week in a new quarter), all new members (and those old members who would like to try a different room), assemble in the cafeteria, where they are called upon one-by-one, and according to their seniority (i.e. days they have been living at UCHA), to select their new room. At this event (i.e BUMP) there will be a display of all rooms that are open for selection. Members may improve their seniority by teaming up with more senior members (e.g. If you team-up with a member who has been living here for one year, then, you will both have an average of six months seniority each). It is not possible to assess one's chances for getting a room of your choice, as it depends on a variety of factors such as the number of residents participating, the amount of senior Co-opers competing, and the resulting vacant rooms open for selection. But on average it takes approximately two years to get a single. Obtaining a double is a bit easier (approximately two quarters), but again, it depends on the competition (at each Bump). This event is held every quarter (except summer), and you don't have to Bump a second time unless you want to change a room, be with a friend in a different room, or you are required to for not meeting the membership standards in a quarter. Depending on space/room availability, and with the consent of both parties, you may apply to live with a member of the opposite gender (possibilities will vary each quarter). This event is solely organized by the membership committee, and they entertain questions and inform students of details regarding the process during the week of this event.</span>

If you want to transfer your admission for a different quarter, that may be possible as well. In this case you would need to email the admissions office and formally request that your admission be forwarded to the next quarter of your choice. The confirmation of your request will depend on space availabilities for that quarter. No space can be considered reserved until you are in receipt of official confirmation from the office of the Executive Director <span class="text-underline">in writing</span>.</span>
